# chat-analysis ðŸ¤–

In this project you will find a small example of how you can leverage data science and simple scripting
to come up with interesting insights about your business ðŸ¦„

# Setup

You will need

- [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)

You will also need to create a database called `chat_analysis` - make sure this is created before running the setup task.
After that's set just `bin/run` for setup and you will have all the data available inside a `conversations` table inside your database.

What you do with it is up for you to decide ðŸ’‚

:warning: Alternative you can just use the `dump` pg export found at the root of this project.
