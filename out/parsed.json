Do you know if she has a HomeCare agreement with us?\nVisitor--950439520-5614(08:42:15):Yes it is reference 910007203696 for an address of 37 Uxbridge Close, Wickford\nKatia(08:42:30):Thanks very much.

Just as you mentioned she's bed bound and I know it can be difficult to keep warm if you're not so mobile, I would like to ask if she'll be okay today without the heating? If she needs it for her health then we can always send an engineer today as an urgent call. \nVisitor--950439520-5614(08:56:38):We have not been using the heating as it has been warm but she does feel the cold so it depends on the weather.\nKatia(08:57:09):Okay, thanks. Shall I leave it for Friday for now, and then if the weather turns then you're able to contact us to make it sooner?\nVisitor--950439520-5614(08:57:41):That's fine with me.

If so when does my existing contract finish?\nElliot(10:54:20):Yes that's right, your current agreement renews on 18.09.2016\nElliot(10:54:38):You have 1 final payment on this current agreement\nVisitor--950439497-6138(10:55:39):So if I reduce the cost to £33.34 now would that start a new contract now? or just amend the existing contract that would still stop on the 18.9.16?\nElliot(10:56:20):No, this would be a change to your current agreement which continues and the renewal date will stay the same date\nElliot(10:56:45):We would then write to you 4 weeks before your renewal date in order to advise of the costs for the upcoming contract\nElliot(10:57:18):So your renewal price will be generated and sent out to you very shortly \nVisitor--950439497-6138(10:58:51):OK, so if I leave the current Homecare 4 contract in place but remove the whitegood cover, because I don't have these anymore, I will still have a chance to modify the whole contract at the renewal date?\nElliot(10:59:15):Yes absolutely\nVisitor--950439497-6138(10:59:35):Good, can you do this please?\nElliot(10:59:52):Yes certainly, I'll process this for you now and confirm the last few details\nElliot(11:02:53):To confirm, your new annual price is £712.91.

Yes you're very right and that's my mistake\nElliot(11:07:34):Thank you for correcting me :)\nElliot(11:08:08):Let me just get that changed for you sir\nElliot(11:13:10):That should read:<br />\nTo confirm, your new annual price is £718.91.

How can I help you today?\nVisitor--950439520-5853(09:30:04):I am at my small holiday cottage in Herefordshire, having a holiday break. The boiler failed last Tuesday, and it was fixed under a British Gas contract last Wednesday. Today it has failed again and an engineer is on the way, but not until an uncertain time between twelve and six pm - so as a holiday day, today is lost.. I believe I can get a discount on a new boiler - which might now be needed. Is that true and if so, could that be done quickly?\nVisitor--950439520-5853(09:31:01):Hello, are you there?\nHayley(09:31:16):There is a £200 discount on new boilers at the moment.

What is the number to call for a quote?\nHayley(09:32:55):That would be the 0800 009 445\nHayley(09:32:57):*4450\nHayley(09:33:03):That would be to book in for a quote.\nVisitor--950439520-5853(09:34:58):They wouldn't need to see the property, it's a small one bedroom, one lounge and one kitchen mid-terrace house - and I would need a so called 'combo boiler'.\nHayley(09:35:34):I'm not sure if it's possible to give you a quote without visiting the property. If you call the installations team they will be able to advise you.\nVisitor--950439520-5853(09:37:07):Which number? The one with 445 at the end, or the one with a star - *4450?\nHayley(09:37:17):The number is 0800 009 4450\nVisitor--950439520-5853(09:37:48):OK, I'll call now to discuss.

I'm afraid our gas engineers wouldn't be able to install the hatch, however this is something that a builder should be able to do for you. The builder would want to check the specifications/building regulations for the hatch too to make sure it's appropriate for your boiler/flue. \nVisitor--950439523-5834(09:27:30):That's what I thought. Okay, I'll get quotes for those works and then be in contact to arrange the annual cover moving forward. Thanks for clarifying.\nKatia(09:29:45):Okay, great, thank you.

My name is\nAshley, how can I help?\nVisitor--950439519-10888(19:21:15):Hello\nAshley(19:21:18):Hi\nVisitor--950439519-10888(19:22:05):I have some troubles with my boiler and was looking into the fixed price one off payment to have it repaired.\nAshley(19:22:30):Sorry you are getting problems with your boiler. \nVisitor--950439519-10888(19:22:42):Is it correct that no matter how big the job and how long it takes that the price will be £459?\nAshley(19:24:34):As long as it can be repaired £459 will be the maximum you will pay for one repair. If there are several faults then the other faults would be charged separately and the engineer would make your aware of this before starting the repair\nVisitor--950439519-10888(19:25:26):Sorry the £459 only applies if there is only one fault?\nVisitor--950439519-10888(19:25:55):In my case it's that several parts need replacing.\nAshley(19:26:42):Ok, the price is for one repair - parts and labour are included, what parts are you requiring for the repair please?\nVisitor--950439519-10888(19:28:15):Rear burner insulation, Front burner insulation, Heat exchanger seals, AAV on pump, Turret clamp on fan, Burner door seal. Also a gas isolation valve.\nAshley(19:31:42):Thanks for that information, the engineer would attend to check this for you as a one-off repair, they would let you know what the one-off repair would cover and what would be charged separately, and give you a quote for any work that would not be covered by the one repair\nVisitor--950439519-10888(19:32:55):What about if I signed up for the boiler repaid and ongoing cover?\nVisitor--950439519-10888(19:33:09):*boiler repair\nAshley(19:34:04):Thanks, it would be the same the £99 for the initial repair would cover one fault, I'll pop the details on both options below for you...\nAshley(19:34:16):The first option, a one off repair is priced\ndependant on the time it takes to complete the repair. The engineer will assess\nthe job and advise you which price bracket you will fall into. Our prices are\nknown as Tiered Pricing, 0-30 minutes will be £89, 31-120 minutes £229, over\n121 minutes £459. This includes Parts and labour.\nAshley(19:34:22):The second option is called the Repair &\nCover agreement. Under the Repair & Cover we will put you on to a HomeCare\nplan for £22 per month to look after your gas boiler with the central heating\nsystem and fix the initial fault for £99 which includes parts, labour and VAT.\nOnce your system is back up and running as normal we will service it to make\nsure it is running safely and efficiently, and you will be covered for repairs\nin the next 12 months with no excess to pay for those repairs including parts\nand labour.\n\nAshley(19:34:27):Full details and information for both options can\nbe found on the following link. \nAshley(19:34:39):<a\n  href=\"http://www.britishgas.co.uk/products-and-services/boilers-and-central-heating/boiler-repairs.html\" target=\"_blank\">Please click here for more details on the repair options</a>\nVisitor--950439519-10888(19:35:51):Do the prices include VAT?\nVisitor--950439519-10888(19:36:26):And for the Repaid and Cover agreement is that a contract for 12 months or 24 months?\nAshley(19:37:29):The one-off repair and £99 for the Repair & Cover initial repair include VAT, the on-going cover at £22 per month includes IPT (Insurance Premium Tax)\nVisitor--950439519-10888(19:38:11):Is the ongoing cover signed up fo2 12 months?\nAshley(19:38:33):Yes that is correct, the on-going cover is for 12 months.\nVisitor--950439519-10888(19:38:50):And after 12 months I would be free to leave if I \nwanted to?\nAshley(19:39:23):Yes, you can leave after the 12 months if you wanted\nVisitor--950439519-10888(19:40:00):OK, and Finally can I decide which of the options to go for after the engineer has been round, or do I have to decide that before he arrives?\nAshley(19:42:10):Thanks, you would need to decide which option you wanted before the engineer calls out. Just to mention that if the engineer comes out on a one-off repair and diagnoses the fault and gives you the price, or prices for that repair and you do not want to go ahead with the repairs you will be charged £89 for the time spent at the proeprty. If you go for the Repair & Cover and we cannot repair it for any reason you will not be charged for the appointment and we will cancel the agreement\nVisitor--950439519-10888(19:43:19):Do you also provide a gas safety certificate or would that be extra?\nAshley(19:44:27):A landlords gas safety certificate?\nVisitor--950439519-10888(19:44:34):No\nVisitor--950439519-10888(19:44:46):Just a normal gas safety certificate\nAshley(19:44:59):Ok, you would get a safety checklist from the engineer\nVisitor--950439519-10888(19:45:18):so he would show that it passes safety?\nAshley(19:47:48):It would be a record of the boilers safety, not whether it passes or fails anything. If it is dangerous the engineer will turn it off until it is repaired and brought up to current safety standards. Once this has been done, if we do the repairs, we would leave you the safety record\nVisitor--950439519-10888(19:48:21):ok that's great thank you very much for your help.\nAshley(19:48:26):Thanks\nVisitor--950439519-10888(19:48:32):Then now I will need to arrange for an appointment.\nVisitor--950439519-10888(19:48:52):Should I phone the Freephone number\nVisitor--950439519-10888(19:48:54):?\nAshley(19:49:33):Thanks, you can take out the Repair & Cover online, or for a one-off repair if you give us a call we can arrange that over the phone for you\nVisitor--950439519-10888(19:50:08):Great thank you very much.\nAshley(19:51:03):Thanks for chatting with me today about the boiler repair.

How can I help you today?\nVisitor--950439497-5554(08:25:16):hello I'm looking for a service for my boiler - is that the gas appliance check?\nKatia(08:25:48):Yes, that's right :)\nKatia(08:26:15):If you input your postcode into the quote bar you can get a quote and then proceed to purchase online if you wish to. \nVisitor--950439497-5554(08:27:57):it says that it does not cover fixing the boiler tho so if there was an issue would the maintenance man be able to fix it at an extra charge?\nKatia(08:30:06):Our service engineer may not be able to do it there and then, as there will only be enough time scheduled for your service however they could definitely quote for you and arrange a revisit if required. Is everything working okay as far as you're aware?\nVisitor--950439497-5554(08:31:43):well thats what i want checked! i have noticed that over the summer the boiler has been a bit intermittant and radiators probably need bleeding. would this be a different service?\nKatia(08:32:56):If you've noticed problems with it then this would usually require a repair, for example the boiler not lighting would indicate a fault. Would you like  a quote for our repair options?\nVisitor--950439497-5554(08:33:14):ok\nKatia(08:33:47):Sure, could I take your postcode please in order to check the prices in your area?\nVisitor--950439497-5554(08:33:56):gu520yq\nKatia(08:34:09):Thanks. \nKatia(08:34:26):There are 2 options.  <br />\n\n1. A one off repair is priced dependent on the time it takes to complete the\nrepair. The engineer will assess the job and advise you of which price bracket\nyou will fall in. Our prices are known as Tiered Pricing, 0-30 minutes £79,\n31-120 minutes £199, over 121 minutes £409. This includes Parts and labour.<u />\n\n\n<br />\n<b> </b>\n\n\n<br />\n2. For the repair and cover agreement we will\nfix the initial repair for £99 this includes parts and labour. You then pay £22 per month which covers you for\nfuture breakdowns to the boiler and central heating system for a year. You also\nget an annual service.\nKatia(08:34:34): \n\n<br />\n\nIf you would like to arrange a repair, our\nCustomer Service team on 0800 294 9650 will be happy to book your appointment\nfor you. Alternatively you're also able to arrange the Repair and Cover option\nonline via <a\n  href=\"http://www.britishgas.co.uk/products-and-services/boilers-and-central-heating/boiler-repairs.html\" target=\"_blank\"><b>this\nlink.</b></a>\nVisitor--950439497-5554(08:38:03):blimey thats a bit steep\nKatia(08:38:30):Sorry about that, those are our options available for repairs. \nVisitor--950439497-5554(08:39:36):well i don't know for sure that its not working properly - I am just being prepared ahead of winter - the boiler is less than 4 years old\nKatia(08:40:29):Okay, thanks. Again we can always attend and do a service and if the engineer finds an issue they can quote you for a repair. \nVisitor--950439497-5554(08:41:19):ok thanks\nKatia(08:41:45):You're\nvery welcome. Is there anything else that I can help you with today?      \nVisitor--950439497-5554(08:44:02):if you book online can you select the date and time of the visit\nKatia(08:44:54):You would purchase the service first and then book your date in once your contract confirmation comes through with your account number etc. \nVisitor--950439497-5554(08:47:16):how do i select a one-off visit at it seems to be setting me up for an annual direct debit\nKatia(08:48:52):Yes it is for an annual service so we'll contact you again next year to see if you would like another service. If you don't wish to have your boiler serviced again next year then that's fine, and we'll have just done it for this year. \nKatia(08:51:49):Is\nthere anything else that I can help you with today?                                                   \nKatia(08:53:36):Thanks\nfor chatting with me today. If that’s everything, have a nice day and take\ncare. \n"

This is because our agreements don't include pre-existing faults, so we have repair options available. The Repair and Cover is priced higher monthly to allow for a fixed price repair at the start. If you would like to add plumbing, drains and electrics then we can do that however this would be an additional cost too. \nVisitor--950439520-6374(11:34:54):I don't understand \nVisitor--950439520-6374(11:35:15):Why is it not £99 then £16.50 per month \nVisitor--950439520-6374(11:35:47):What if the repair to boiler is only very minimal\nKatia(11:36:22):Because the monthly amount is increased to allow for you to have a fixed price repair for £99. The other option is a one off repair, which can range from £79-£459 depending on how long it takes the engineer to complete the repair. \nVisitor--950439520-6374(11:36:58):Ok might be cheaper for me to have one off repair then \nVisitor--950439520-6374(11:37:32):And then book the £16.50 monthly one afterwards ?\nVisitor--950439520-6374(11:38:01):I'm a single mum struggling! Finance is tight so needing to get the best value \nKatia(11:38:36):Yes it's always best to compare your options! That would be fine, we can arrange your repair.

Can I start by asking for your name?\nVisitor--950439521-6307(11:12:45):Peter Bolton\nAlex(11:12:57):Hi there Peter, I hope you are well. How can I help today? \nVisitor--950439521-6307(11:14:43):I recently tried to see if I could get a smart meter installation and was asked if my existing meter were easily accessible. what does this mean?\nAlex(11:16:27):Well, essentially we are asking if the engineer will be able to readily access your existing meters easily to make the upgrade and that the space is safe and they can work in it. \nVisitor--950439521-6307(11:18:06):The problem is that my gas meter is outside on the house front wall  but the electricity meter is inside in a cupboard under stairs\nAlex(11:18:38):Not to worry, this shouldn't be an issue as long as he can access the electricity meter on the day. \nAlex(11:19:11):As the meter is a replacement for your existing one, it's not essential that there's much extra space than there already is, so not to worry about the under the stairs meter there. \nAlex(11:20:28):Can I help with anything else at all today Peter? \nVisitor--950439521-6307(11:22:03):But the online reply ,after signing up to new contract said that new meters could not yet be fitted\nAlex(11:22:56):OK, so there may be further eligiblity criteria that unfortunately you don't meet at this time. It's unlikely to be related to your meter location. \nAlex(11:23:07):Just to clarify, are you a new or existing customer Peter? \nVisitor--950439521-6307(11:23:35):Existing dual fuel customer\nAlex(11:23:55):OK, well I'd be happy to check why that might be for you then. Could I please take the full address of the property? \nVisitor--950439521-6307(11:24:27):10 St.James's Avenue\nVisitor--950439521-6307(11:24:55):Beckenham BR3 4HG\nAlex(11:25:27):Thanks very much for that, OK please bear with me a moment whilst I get that checked out for you. \nAlex(11:26:43):OK, so I'll just need to go through a few quick questions with you in order to check if we can install our meters there. Firstly, what type of property is it? \nVisitor--950439521-6307(11:27:05):End terrace house\nAlex(11:27:31):OK, and are there any solar panels or other micro-generation equipment present at the property? \nVisitor--950439521-6307(11:27:44):No\nAlex(11:28:40):OK, so I don't believe there are any issues with fitting our meters there then. Would you like to proceed with booking an appointment online with me now? \nVisitor--950439521-6307(11:29:05):Yes Please\nAlex(11:29:40):Great, so the earliest appointment I have is Thursday 18th of August between 8AM-12PM. Would that work for you Peter? \nVisitor--950439521-6307(11:30:44):Yes that would be fine\nAlex(11:32:01):Great, so finally we just need to go through a few additional questions in order to help our engineer out on the day Peter.<br />\n<br />\nFirstly, your Smart Meters are free of charge and fitting them will take up to 2 hours and your supply will be switched off for some time. Is there mains powered medical equipment in your home or anyone who would be affected by having the gas or electricity switched off? \nVisitor--950439521-6307(11:34:07):No Nothing like that apart from broad band connection. How is the external gas meter powered to communicate with display? Battery!!\nAlex(11:35:57):OK, then not to worry. That's correct, it's powered by battery and communicates using cellular technology similar to a mobile telephone. <br />\n<br />\nNext, during your appointment our engineer will offer you some energy efficiency advice. If you like, they can also tell you about relevant products that could help to reduce your energy consumption. They'll only tell you about British Gas products but other companies may also provide them. If they think there are some products that would be of benefit to you, would you like to hear about them?\nVisitor--950439521-6307(11:37:12):Yes if it would be useful\nAlex(11:37:26):Great and once your Smart Meters have been fitted you can go online to view a regular report that shows you when and how you use your energy. To show your usage within each day we'll need to set your meters to collect the reading every 30 minutes, is that OK?  \nVisitor--950439521-6307(11:38:56):Yes and I take it that I will no longer have to provide quarterly readings.\nAlex(11:39:38):That's correct, your meter readings will be supplied to us automatically after your Smart Meter has been installed. <br />\n<br />\nFinally, the engineer will try to call you before visiting your home. What is the best contact number for you? If you have a mobile number, that would be great. <br />\n\t<br />\nAlso you'll receive an email confirmation of your appointment as well as further emails letting you know what will happen on the day. What is the best email address to use?\nVisitor--950439521-6307(11:40:05):Telephone\nVisitor--950439521-6307(11:40:28):02086501272\nVisitor--950439521-6307(11:40:56):Email petruvius@btinternet.com\nAlex(11:42:39):Thanks very much for that, OK that's all booked in for Thursday 18th of August between 8AM-12PM. Just to confirm that the smart meters are free of charge and your tariff will stay the same and just to remind you, your supply will be switched off for two hours for the appointment and the engineer can arrive at any point during the time slot.  Is that all OK Peter? \nVisitor--950439521-6307(11:44:05):That is all OK and thanks Alex you have been most helpful.\nINFO(11:45:55):Visitor has printed chat transcript\nAlex(11:46:41):That's my pleasure! Can I help with anythign else at all today? \nVisitor--950439521-6307(11:49:51):No .Thank you very much for all your help. Bye\nAlex(11:50:06):Great, well thanks for chatting with me today. To end our chat, please click the exit button. You’ll get a short survey which I’d be grateful for you to complete. Have a good day!\nINFO(11:50:44):Visitor has printed chat transcript\n",

I can see that your Gas is currently not on a direct debit. \nVisitor--950439521-6927(13:44:21):So that I can pay by direct debit could you advise the monthly amount for both gas and electricity\nLaura(13:44:33):For the Electricity based on the current credit and the usage on your account I'll be able to reduce this to £25 per month for you. This may still mean that you're in credit at the end of your plan - if you are we'll automatically refund this back to your bank. \nLaura(13:45:57):Based on the Gas credit and usage if you'd like me to set up a direct debit the amount I could set this to would be £37.80 per month. \nLaura(13:49:33):Are you there?\nVisitor--950439521-6927(13:49:53):please do reduce it to £25.For the moment, I will leave the gas without a direct debit as I'm soon moving house.\nLaura(13:51:02):OK that's fine I'll get that done for you now - Please bear with me a moment. \nLaura(13:51:32):I've done this for you now - y\nLaura(13:51:48):you'll be sent the confirmation through the post. \nVisitor--950439521-6927(13:52:03):thank you so much-most helpful\nLaura(13:52:23):I understand that you're moving house once you've moved please rememebr to take readings on the day you move ot so that we can close your accounts. \nLaura(13:52:46):We can also have a look at your supplier at your new property and see if we can get you on a good tariff. \nLaura(13:53:00):Is there anything else I can help you with today?\nVisitor--950439521-6927(13:53:46):I will remember that.I will contact you again when once I've moved\nLaura(13:54:04):Thanks\nfor chatting with me today.  If\nyou’ve a spare couple of minutes you’ll be sent a survey after the chat has\nended to leave feedback on how you felt I dealt with your enquiry on web chat\ntoday.

Can I start by asking for your name?\nVisitor--950439523-7528(14:29:32):Robert Legg\nAlex(14:29:44):Hi there Robert, I hope you are well. How can I help today? \nVisitor--950439523-7528(14:30:21):Good thanks. I am looking to upgrade to a smart meter. I am an existing customer. I would like to take advantage of the free Saturday/sunday offer.\nAlex(14:31:21):Great, so I'd be happy to help you booked in for a Smart Meter appointment but just so you are aware, the free electricity on a weekend day offer is actually part of our new HomeEnergy FreeTime tariff and you'd need to switch over to this tariff before you were eligible for the free period. \nAlex(14:31:51):If you are interested in switching your tariff over it's nice and easy to do online and you can actually book your appointment to upgrade your meters as part of that switch over process. Would you like me to run you through how to do so? \nVisitor--950439523-7528(14:32:02):Is this an inflated tariff to cover the costs then?\nVisitor--950439523-7528(14:32:17):I would prefer to have a smart meter appointment first.\nAlex(14:32:45):No, outside of the free period you'll be charged at the same as our standard unit rates Robert.\nAlex(14:33:09):OK then, in order to get a Smart Meter appointment booked in I'll need to take the full address of the property please. \nVisitor--950439523-7528(14:33:35):37 Manor Drive, Cottingley, Bingley, BD16 1PL\nAlex(14:35:21):Thanks very much for that, so I've had a look at the account and it appears that you have a multi phase meter (Economy 7/10), which means you get cheaper off peak overnight electricity. Unfortunately our smart meter technology can't support this type of meter yet. Our technology is developing all the time though so what I can do is register your interest in our Smart Meters which means you'll be notified as soon as we are able to upgrade your meters for you Robert. \nAlex(14:37:19):Would you like for me to do that for you Robert? \nVisitor--950439523-7528(14:37:45):We moved in and this meter was already installed. The economy 7 circuitry has been removed so we are charged at the same rate for both night/day. How do you know what type of meter I have. No one from British Gas has visited my house yet to inspect it...\nAlex(14:39:51):That would be because your meter information is listed on the national grid data base Robert, so we wouldn't need to visit to determine this. Now, if you have moved to a single rate then you should contact customer services on 0800 048 0202 and they will update this information for you on your account, as currently I'm afraid I can't book an appointment for you until this has been done. \nVisitor--950439523-7528(14:40:47):But what difference will this make? British Gas know I am on a single rate....they sold it to me\nAlex(14:42:34):Well as long as the system is showing that the property has an multi phase meter you won't be able to book an appointment for a Smart Meter upgrade with myself or via your online account I'm afraid. \nAlex(14:43:12):If you have changed and this isn't showing on your account then you will need to speak to customer services who can get this changed for you today Robert. \nVisitor--950439523-7528(14:44:54):ok. Thanks. Dealing with energy companies is ALWAYS difficult in my experience. I can never get a straight answer or details are always wrong.\n"

How can I help ?\nRhydian(12:57:33):I'm sorry to hear this *\nVisitor--950439520-6791(12:59:39):I have just complained about a missed appointment by your engineers to fit new smart meters and whilst you advisor was perfectly pleasant and helpful, I am left confused as to why a system that contacts you one way to confirm an appointment try's unsuccessfully via another method and then assumes the customer got the message and forgets them\nRhydian(13:01:48):Ok, I'm sorry that you have missed the engineer for your smart meter installation. How did the engineer attempt to contact you ?\nVisitor--950439520-6791(13:02:50):It would appear that smart meters are unable to cope with solar panels, one of the hyped areas to cover the assumed 50/50 generation buyback also to be used to more accurately predict solar generation to grid\nVisitor--950439520-6791(13:06:06):The engineer did not attempt to contact me, however on contacting British gas, an attempt was made 5 days ago, but as no voice mail is on this account, it was just dropped. My question to your colleague was surely if a confirmation email had been received and confirmed, why would you not contact via a known method than just assume a missed call would be understood.\nRhydian(13:06:14):Currently, our smart meter technology is unable to differentiate between the energy you use and the energy you produce from the solar panels. As a result, you can end up being over charged. As a precaution, we don't install smart meters into homes that have micro-generation equipment as we don't want customer being over charged.\nRhydian(13:08:39):Would I be able to take your address and post code and I will have a look into this for you. \nVisitor--950439520-6791(13:09:59):The other point is this, when I made the appointment, surely your computer equipment is able to automatically crosscheck our account to see just using the customer profile for the address, we are by our being early adaptors of micro generation unsuitable for an appointment\nRhydian(13:12:11):I'm sorry we were not able to fit your Smart Meters and thank you for sharing your concern regarding the way we contacted you about your appointment. You say that you have contacted us today to complain about this.  Please can I take your details so that I can check your account details?  You haven't been specific about what you would like me to do to help you.\nVisitor--950439520-6791(13:12:20):You are more than welcome to our address and account, however it has been dealt with as a missed appointment and £30.00 for such and yes whilst this is nice, surely the point is the missed opportunity to utilise the data you currently hold to not waste time on such mistakes\nRhydian(13:13:03):Thank you for this feedback.  I will pass it on.  Is there anything else I can help you with?\nVisitor--950439520-6791(13:13:46):No thank you and sorry for ranting!\nRhydian(13:14:05):Have a lovely day.  If you no longer wish to chat please click 'end chat'.  Take care.\n"

Bleeding a radiator would not be classed as a repair.\nVisitor--950439497-7557(14:43:19):great, many thanks.  two last questions, would i need to book the engineer, or could the tenant ring up and book it?  if they rang, what details would they need to give and what number would they call?\nLee(14:43:39):It would need to be yourself.\nLee(14:44:13):This is because with all repair booking under excess policies, we would ask you to confirm some card details for payment to be taken if a repair is completed.\nVisitor--950439497-7557(14:45:07):ok thanks for your assistance - very helpful :-)\nLee(14:45:23):You’re\nwelcome.

As I explained the last time I complained, I am not able to book my annual service online. I can't do it by phone and I didn't register for a telephone service. You keep sending me reminders that my service is overdue, a fact of which I'm acutely aware, but I am still unable to book online. Please book me a Wednesday appointment as this is the only day I can be at home - unless you offer weekend appointments which I realise is highly unlikely - and email me the date and time. Thank you\nAshley(14:35:44):Hi my name is Ashley and I am from HomeCare customer services. I am just reading your message.\nAshley(14:36:43):I am sorry to hear that the website is not letting you book this in.

During out of hours emergencies such as after 10pm on weedays or after 6 pm on weekends you might need to contact us by phone. Is that okay?\nAshley(14:46:26):Can I check is your boiler working okay at the moment?\nVisitor--950439523-7588(14:46:50):I understand that for emergencies but I can't understand why a service offered online is unable to function online.

Also I don't want a load of unwanted calls.

They can call on your home number if that's more reliable. \nVisitor--950439523-7588(14:57:26):I don't use a landline, the number you have for me is my work number. My mobile number is 07760659605, they can use that to text their expected arrival time\nAshley(14:58:28):I have booked that in for you and left a note for the engineer to text when they are on their way. \nVisitor--950439523-7588(14:59:02):Thanks for your help Ashley, please can you email confirmation\nAshley(14:59:17):You should receive text confirmation \nAshley(14:59:30):and also be able to view it in your online account if you login now.\nAshley(14:59:39):Would that be sufficient? \nVisitor--950439523-7588(15:00:04):I'd prefer an email but I expect the text will get here eventually\nAshley(15:00:36):Can you log into your account now?

May I please take the full address of the property? \nVisitor--950439519-6101(10:29:49):16 kilvington road woodthorpe Sheffield s13 8af\nAlex(10:30:29):OK, so I've had a look at the account and it appears that we only supply the gas at the property is that correct Jean? \nVisitor--950439519-6101(10:31:18):No I'm with gas and electricity  with British gas\nAlex(10:33:58):I am sorry but there only appears to be a gas account registered under your name Jean.

I am afraid as there is only a gas account in your name at the property at the moment we wouldn't be able to upgrade your meters for Smart Meters as we can't upgrade gas only accounts. \nAlex(10:38:23):However if you contact customer services on 0800 048 0303 they will be happy to find out what is going on with your electricity. \nVisitor--950439519-6101(10:39:19):Ok thank you for your help\nAlex(10:39:44):That's my pleasure and I hope that everything is sorted out for you nice and quickly and that we can upgrade your meters for you soon.

I can go look to see if a reduction can be offered.\nMohan(09:17:50):Are you happy with your level of cover or would you\nconsider removing part of your agreement to bring down the cost?\nVisitor--950439522-5764(09:18:38):i only wanted the annual boiler service and boiler controls.\nMohan(09:19:40):OK, so currently you have boiler, controls and central heating cover along with a service. I am able to reduce this to boiler and controls cover with an annual service. I will work out the price for you now Lisa. One moment please.\nVisitor--950439522-5764(09:20:27):Thank you.\nMohan(09:22:28):Thanks for your patience Lisa. I have worked out the price to reduce the level of cover to the boiler and controls with a service. The monthly price is approximately £26.13. Shall I process this for you?\nVisitor--950439522-5764(09:24:12):Why is it so expensive, looking at the website i could homecare 4 from around 17.50  per month.\nVisitor--950439522-5764(09:25:29):I have a quote online for homecare one which is £10?\nMohan(09:25:43):The prices advertised online include a £60 excess charge for repairs, your policy does not include this. Also, after the first year of the agreement, a few different factors can affect the price. Things like the\nsize of the central heating system, breakdown history and where you live\n(hard/soft water, ease to reach location). size of the system, number of radiators and age of the boiler will affect the price. \nMohan(09:26:12):As your policy currently includes a £0 excess, would amending\nthe excess on your cover be something you would like to do at all?\nVisitor--950439522-5764(09:27:14):Ok so i have removed this excess and was quoted 16. Can i get this deal?\nMohan(09:27:54):I am able to offer a reduction, but I would be able to get it down to £16, as the factors I mentioned earlier are considered Lisa.\nMohan(09:28:02):Let me see what I can do for you. One moment please.\nMohan(09:34:31):Thanks for your patience. So by downgrading the policy to Homecare 100, without any excess it would be £26.13. I am then able to offer a discount. This will then bring the payments down to approximately  £24.56 per month for the remaining 4 installments.\nVisitor--950439522-5764(09:35:29):OK could I cancel my policy now and buy the cover online?\nMohan(09:35:48):You cancel the cover but wouldn't be able to set up online for 3 months Lisa. \nVisitor--950439522-5764(09:37:50):Ok if that is not an option can i downgrade the policy today?\nMohan(09:38:04):Of course.\nMohan(09:38:46):Shall I go ahead and downgrade that for you?\nVisitor--950439522-5764(09:40:20):Please\nMohan(09:41:45):OK, I will go ahead and process this for you now. One moment please.\nMohan(09:46:15):Thanks for your patience. Your next direct debit will be £24.56 on 27/08/2016 and then £24.53 each month after. Your\noutstanding balance is £98.15. These prices include the discount I have applied, as well as Insurance\nPremium Tax. This price will run up until your next renewal date on 28/11/2016.<br />\nMohan(09:46:42):The cover is now for the boiler and controls along with an annual service.\nMohan(09:47:20):That’s all done\nfor you now, is there anything else I can help you with today?\nVisitor--950439522-5764(09:47:33):No thanks.\nVisitor--950439522-5764(09:47:42):thank you for your time\nMohan(09:47:57):You're welcome.

So at the moment I can't give you a clearer idea when they will be there, but they will give you a call prior to arrival.\nVisitor--950439522-8079(15:26:32):When I booked the call I was promised they would be here before5.00pm as I have to take my Dad to a doctor's appointment at5.40\nHayley(15:27:18):There is a note on there to say before 5pm. It can still be before 5pm, as it can get scheduled to an engineer at any time.\nVisitor--950439522-8079(15:28:21):Are you saying it will definitely be before 5.00pm? Thank you\nHayley(15:28:39):Yes it will be, but the engineer can arrive anytime up to 5pm.\nVisitor--950439522-8079(15:29:07):If it is later I will have to reschedule \nHayley(15:29:22):Of course. You won't receive any penalty if you have to reschedule last minute.\nVisitor--950439522-8079(15:29:35):Thank you\n"

The latest bill is actually very low, as you would expect for summer usage. It is £42.73 over 93 days, of which £24.18 will be daily standing charges.\nVisitor--950439523-5722(09:04:09):So why would my DD be going up? from 28 to 50?\nMatt(09:04:27):We look at Direct Debit payments over a 12 month period & I think we may have underestimated you're January bill, which led to a higher bill in May & it will be the balance on the account which we're trying to reduce before winter which has caused the increase in the direct debits. \nMatt(09:04:40):I'll just have a check and see if it needs to be as high as it is\nVisitor--950439523-5722(09:06:08):It seems extremely high and in this case I will be actively looking to leave if it remains so high\nMatt(09:06:18):Having a look at your forecasted usage until the end of the year, I do think the system has increased your payments too much. I would suggest they probably do need to be a bit higher, but not as much as they are\nMatt(09:06:49):I think you could set it at £40 per month and still be OK at the end of the plan. I can change this around for you now, if you'd like?\nVisitor--950439523-5722(09:07:46):That would be a lot better thank you\nMatt(09:08:56):Basing it around what you used last winter, £40 would be a little more than you used. However, it should get rid of the balance on the account and also give you a little leeway in case of a worse winter. I'd suggest keeping an eye on your account moving forward and see how you get on\nMatt(09:09:04):I'll get that changed for you now.\nVisitor--950439523-5722(09:09:09):I will for sure keep a closer eye\nVisitor--950439523-5722(09:09:11):Many Thanks\nVisitor--950439523-5722(09:09:20):Will I be notified or the change or is it just when I log in?\nMatt(09:10:12):You should get a notification of both the bill and the direct debit change by email in the next 48 hours. Or it will be showing on your online account by tomorrow at the latest\nVisitor--950439523-5722(09:10:25):Appreciate your help- thank very much\nVisitor--950439523-5722(09:10:26):Shane\nMatt(09:10:39):No problems, is there anything else I can have a look at for you today?\n"

One last question its regarding the annual service of the boiler and when does this take place.  Is it booked automatically once the home care cover starts?\nHayley(10:41:26):We will ask you to book it once you have set the cover up. This is done as soon as possible, depending on engineer availability in your area. We aim to get it done within the first 42 days.\nVisitor--950439497-6123(10:42:07):Ok. Many thanks.  I presume I will have to key this online to get the discount rather than over the phone?\nHayley(10:42:45):\nThat's right, to get the 10% discount it needs to be done through the website.

Another product I have been looking at is changing to the free electricity at weekends, I am currently prepay is this possible to change to and what would the cost be.\nElliot(11:31:33):Yes absolutely \nElliot(11:31:43):Our energy team can help you switch over\nElliot(11:31:48):Would you like their telephone number?\nVisitor--950439497-6321(11:31:54):yes please\nElliot(11:32:05):Of course, you can reach them now on 0800 048 0202\nVisitor--950439497-6321(11:33:01):OK Elliot, thank you very much for your help I will call them today.\nElliot(11:33:22):My pleasure :) is there anything else I could help\nyou with today?\nVisitor--950439497-6321(11:33:35):No that is all.\nVisitor--950439497-6321(11:33:46):Good bye have a great day\nElliot(11:33:50):Okay!

The account has  Customer reference number 910006124941. The reference number of my request to is XXXXXXXX.\nVisitor--950439522-7218(13:59:02):hello?\nFreddie(13:59:27):Hi there, this is because to do this you would need to get in contact with us directly through either web chat or on the phone. I can pass you through to our customer care team if this is something you want doing\nVisitor--950439522-7218(14:01:33):Well, someone should have got in touch with me and told me what to do, but no one replied, though the response said someone would get back to me within three days. And also I just tried to phone, but it asked me to type my account number into the phone keypad, and it insisted that it must start with 85 - but it doesn't, it starts with 95.\nFreddie(14:02:12):I appreciate that, so what we can do is pass you over to our customer care team now to get this sorted. Is there a particular reason you are looking to get this cancelled?\nVisitor--950439522-7218(14:02:29):I sold the property in mid-April.\nFreddie(14:03:43):Okay sure - Let me pass you through :)\nVisitor--950439522-7218(14:03:57):Thanks Freddie.\nFreddie(14:04:25):Sorry there is a little bit of a wait. Just waiting for one of the advisors to be available\nKatia(14:07:46):Good afternoon, you're through to Katia. I'm just loading your account. Could I take your full name too please?\nVisitor--950439522-7218(14:07:56):Sara Hopkins\nKatia(14:08:07):Thank you Sara. \nKatia(14:08:51):I understand you're cancelling as you've moved. Would you like to move it to your new address?\nVisitor--950439522-7218(14:09:37):No, I've already got cover on my current address. I had landlord cover on the property I'm cancelling for so clearly I was letting it out.\nKatia(14:09:38):Sorry actually I've loaded your account and can see it's a rental address. \nKatia(14:10:51):I'm just going through the cancellation on my system for you no. \nKatia(14:10:52):now *\nVisitor--950439522-7218(14:10:54):Can you tell me what the monthly direct debit amount for the account 910006124941 is please?\nKatia(14:11:37):Sure, I'll just come out of the cancellation screen for a moment. \nKatia(14:12:23):It's £24. 46 for your monthly direct debit. \nVisitor--950439522-7218(14:12:35):Many thanks Katia.\nKatia(14:13:12):You're welcome. I'm just processing your cancellation now. \nKatia(14:14:09):Just to confirm that you will no longer be covered under\nthe boiler and controls cover and gas safety certificate from midnight tonight. I can see that you\nare due a partial refund of £24.38\nwhich will be paid to your bank account that we have on record and will be with\nyou within 7-10 working days. You will also receive\npost/email confirmation of the cancellation within 7-10 working days.<br />\n<br />\nVisitor--950439522-7218(14:17:36):Many thanks, Katia, much appreciated. I did make a request in mid-June for this to be cancelled via the web form but nothing happened. I gather I should have used phone or chat for a cancellation, but no one responded to my web form request to tell me that. The reference number of the web form request is XXXXXXXX. Given that, I wonder if I might be refunded for the period from June 20th to today?\nKatia(14:18:52):Yes it would usually be on the phone or on the chat, but I will just check that with my manager for you and see if I can backdate it as you did submit the form to request it. Just a moment please :)\nVisitor--950439522-7218(14:19:15):Thanks again Katia.\nKatia(14:20:45):You're welcome. I've managed to backdate it to 20th June for you. My system has changed your refund amount to £61.84! Always worth asking! That will be paid to your bank account that we have on record and will be with you within 7-10 working days.\nVisitor--950439522-7218(14:21:19):That's great news! Many thanks again for your help with this, Katia.\nKatia(14:21:40):You're very welcome, happy to help. That's all done for you now.  Is\nthere anything else that I can help you with today?\nVisitor--950439522-7218(14:22:04):No, that's everything.\nKatia(14:22:19):Okay. Thanks\nfor chatting with me today. If that’s everything, have a nice afternoon and take\ncare.\nVisitor--950439522-7218(14:22:36):Thank you, I hope you have a nice afternoon too.\nKatia(14:22:50):Thank you, bye for now. \n"

I want to cancel my contract with you\nElliot(13:31:02):I'm sorry to hear that, would you like the telephone number for our Customer Care team so that we can help you with this?\nVisitor--950439522-7017(13:31:34):Yes please.  It should be easy to find on your website really\nElliot(13:32:10):No problem at all, you can reach the team on 0800 294 9123\nVisitor--950439522-7017(13:32:43):But then theres always a long painful wait for your phone lines.  Can you just cancel it now?\nElliot(13:33:45):I can certainly discuss this with you now\nElliot(13:33:48):May\nI take your full name and either your Homecare reference number or your address\nplease?\nVisitor--950439522-7017(13:34:19):I attached to this chat from the app.  So yiu should have it all.\nVisitor--950439522-7017(13:34:26):Name steve watts\nVisitor--950439522-7017(13:34:38):Post code co6 1uh\nVisitor--950439522-7017(13:34:57):Post code of ptoperty covered is co1 1ru\nElliot(13:37:23):Thank you, this information isn't passed through from the app you see\nElliot(13:37:41):May I take the first line of address of the property in question please?\nVisitor--950439522-7017(13:37:57):52 albert road\nVisitor--950439522-7017(13:38:03):Colchester\nElliot(13:39:12):Thank you\nElliot(13:40:56):I see that you have our Homecare 200, landlord's gas safety check for the cooker and oven, as well as the gas safety certificate for the boiler, cooker and oven\nElliot(13:41:05):Is there a particular reason that you'd like to cancel this cover?\nVisitor--950439522-7017(13:43:19):Its expensive and this year was more trouble than it worth.  Last year you list the certificates and unnecessarily cancelled the contract.  The app always tells me a service is due.  And for the same money i pay you i could use my friendly local plumber and buy a brand new boiler every 4 years...with a 5 year guarantee\nVisitor--950439522-7017(13:43:38):You're just not worth the money you charge\nElliot(13:44:10):Okay, I can appreciate that, I'm sorry that your experience of our service hasn't been the best. Would lowering the cost of your cover change your mind?\nVisitor--950439522-7017(13:44:38):Would have to go down a very long way\nElliot(13:45:10):Okay certainly, I'll take you through a few options that might help\nElliot(13:45:24):If I could check - are you happy with your level of cover or would you\nconsider removing part of your agreement to bring down the cost?<br />\nVisitor--950439522-7017(13:46:46):Its the balue for money I'm concerned with\nElliot(13:47:32):Okay, would adding an excess to your cover be something\nyou would like to do at all?\nVisitor--950439522-7017(13:48:43):But then i would still face a bill for work to an old boiler at probably extortionate costs.  \nVisitor--950439522-7017(13:48:59):How do the excesses work?\nElliot(13:51:09):The excess would be £50 and you would pay this for each completed repair, inclusive of the parts and labour costs. If you wanted to go ahead with this change, your monthly payments would be lowered to £25.06\nVisitor--950439522-7017(13:51:57):I dont see how that is better than what ive got.  In fact its worse\nVisitor--950439522-7017(13:52:33):I'm better off running a piggy bank insurance and taking a hit for each event.\nElliot(13:52:58):Okay, I’ll see\nwhat I can do about the price if we keep your level of cover as it is. I’ll\njust be 2-3 minutes.\nElliot(13:55:09):I can certainly apply a discount without having to alter your level of cover, this would reduce your monthly payments to £24.81\nVisitor--950439522-7017(13:56:25):Thanks Elliot.  But thats still £300 per year for what is effectively an £80 service and cp12\nElliot(13:57:19):No, your agreement includes cover for your boiler and central heating. If you'd like to lower your Homecare 200 agreement to a one-off boiler service then I can certainly get you a price for this\nVisitor--950439522-7017(13:59:26):No its ok thanks.  I think i'd prefer to cut the stress and give the work to my local plumber.  He does my other houses.  If he packs up or moves i'll think about coming back.  \nElliot(13:59:43):Okay certainly, I'll get this cancellation processed for you now\nElliot(13:59:49):Do bear with me please\nVisitor--950439522-7017(13:59:59):Ok thanks\nElliot(14:03:47):Just to confirm that you will no longer be covered under\nthe Homecare 200, landlord's gas safety check for the cooker and oven, as well as the gas safety certificate for the boiler, cooker and oven from today 10.08.2016.<b><u /></b>\nVisitor--950439522-7017(14:04:08):Ok thanks\nElliot(14:04:21):You will also receive\npost/email confirmation of the cancellation within 7-10 working days.\nElliot(14:04:24):That’s all done\nfor you now, is there anything else I can help you with today?\nVisitor--950439522-7017(14:04:47):No thats fine thanks.  Thank you for trying to help\nElliot(14:05:30):My pleasure, is there anything else I could help\nyou with today?\nVisitor--950439522-7017(14:06:32):No thanks\nElliot(14:06:42):Okay!

How can I assist you today?\nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:01:21):Right I'm getting a bit annoyed having to contact British gas constantly, I had an email the other day telling me my direct debit is changing and I will be charged over £500 a month\nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:02:30):I rang British gas just last week to complain about my meter readings AGAIN and it turned out my meter is faulty and someone is coming out to fix it therefor all meter readings are again wrong so where has this £500 a month come from?\nLuke(16:02:38):I'm sorry to hear this. I will help sort this. Can I please take some details to help me find your account and for security? What’s your full name, house number, post code and date of birth please?\nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:03:09):Hayley Edmunds, 7 CV35 0SS 26/07/1991\nLuke(16:03:40):Thank you, bear with me a moment whilst I look into your account\nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:03:45):OK\nLuke(16:06:00):I'm just checking the notes on your account to see what's happened. I won't be a moment\nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:06:07):OK\n#\nLuke(16:10:22):Sorry for the delay, I'm just making sure I get the correct information\nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:10:31):OK thats fine\nLuke(16:11:29):I've looked into your account and can see that there is a job for the meter to be changed on the 25th August 2016. What will happen is when this is updated on our system, we'll rebill your account to the new meter readings and will issue a new bill. What I can do in the meantime is manually change your Direct Debit back to the £91 you were paying previously to ensure you don't have £526 leaving your account on the 28th of this month if that is ok?\nLuke(16:11:57):I'll also raise a complaint in regards to this problem that has occured.\nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:12:27):OK can you please put the direct debit on hold\nLuke(16:13:23):I can't put the Direct Debit on hold unfortunately, however I can cancel the Direct Debit and place a lock on the account so you aren't required to pay anything until this is resolved?\nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:13:55):yes pleaase\nLuke(16:14:15):Just to confirm you'd like me to cancel the Direct Debit for the time being?\nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:15:52):yes please\nLuke(16:16:24):Ok, please bear with me a few minutes whilst I get that cancelled and a complaint logged for you\nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:16:42):ok thank you\nLuke(16:21:01):Thank you for waiting. What I've done is logged a complaint regarding this issue and have cancelled the Direct Debit so we won't attempt to collect any payment from your bank - I'd suggest you also cancel this at your bank to be completely sure. \nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:21:42):OK brilliant thank you!\nLuke(16:22:15):Currently there is someone dealing with your enquiry and they'll contact you once the meter has been exchanged and account has been rebilled. At this point you can then set up the Direct Debit again if you so wish, or they can discuss other payment options.\nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:23:00):ok that's brilliant thanks do you know how long after the meter is replaced I will get the new bill?\nLuke(16:23:12):Can I just confirm that you're happy with what I've done for you today and that you're happy for me to close your complaint? The enquiry will still be dealt with by one of my colleagues who'll contact you.\nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:23:59):No I'd like the complaint still on, I have been dealing with this problem since I moved here 2 years ago\nLuke(16:24:57):You should receive a new bill 7-14 working days after the new meter has been fitted.\nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:25:07):only this year I found a fault but I was told at the start of the year my meter was fine! have had ridiculous yearly bills considering I live in a 2 bed small house with my kids eldest being 4 I cannot see how I use this much electric\nLuke(16:29:01):The complaint I'll be raising for you is regarding how the service has been regarding getting this sorted and the problems with your Direct Debit, however unfortunately as it is our back office team that fix/amend your account. The only thing I could further do by leaving your complaint open with myself would be to check the exchange has been done and complete on the 25th?\nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:29:21):OK\n#\nLuke(16:32:14):I've checked the usage on the recent bill which shows that between 31st March 2014 and 8th March 2016, that the total amount was for £1560.79 which is around £780 per year. It looks like you were only paying £12 a month on your Direct Debit before it was increased to £91 which could be where the large debit has built up from as it should be around £65 a month based on the useage alone.\nLuke(16:34:00):Would you like me to check your account after the exchange has happened or are you happy for me to close this complaint and leave your enquiry in the hands of my colleagues who are dealing with the rebill?\nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:41:48):ok i know its all wrong my meter shows the wrong time too\nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:41:53):yes please\nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:42:10):I want it all checked\nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:42:30):I do not want to be over charged any more than I have been\nLuke(16:43:20):Ok, no worries. Just so I'm clear, I can only check the exchange has been completed. The bill will be reviewed by our back office team who are currently dealing with this. \nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:43:48):OK\nLuke(16:44:29):No problem, I'll contact you to confirm the exchange has been fitted on the 25th after which your rebill will be processed. \nLuke(16:45:16):Can I just ask what the best time/day and number is best to contact you on after the meter has been changed?\nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:45:46):afternoon on 01295688147\nLuke(16:46:45):Ok, I'll contact you after 5pm on the 25th August.\nLuke(16:46:54):As the appointment is between 1-5pm\nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:46:59):that would be brilliant\nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:47:04):thank you\nLuke(16:47:13):No problem, is there anything else I can help you with today?\nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:47:21):no thats it thanks\nLuke(16:47:33):You're welcome, have a nice evening.\nVisitor--950439523-8513(16:47:52):and you thanks bye\n"

Would you like your current payment scheme to continue for now or would you like me to adjust it to claim the invoice amount to match your other accounts? \nJohn(11:36:26):We can change your bank details while on the phone, or this can be adjusted if you're able to log into your online account. Could I please ask that you request to have this changed once the business is sold? \nVisitor--950439520-6334(11:37:50):Please leave it as it is at present, I will contact you again when the sale has gone through to change the details.\nJohn(11:39:09):OK.

Do you use this yourself to manage your account? \nVisitor--950439520-6334(11:40:32):Yes I manage the details online but this account was not on and I have registered today\nJohn(11:41:48):Excellent.

These include the make, model, and age of your boiler, as\nwell as the size of your property and also your boiler and breakdown history\nfor the past two years and previous discount history. This means that the price\nof your cover is unique to you and is line with what we've calculated to be a\nfair cost to cover you.<br />\nVisitor--950439497-6640(12:44:00):It isn't a fair price, It's a hike of almost 33%, based on this when the boiler is 3 years old I'll be paying circa £470. The bolier is not old. I had an older one where I lived and you charged less. I am looking top pay circa £180 for the year, I think this is fair\nVisitor--950439497-6640(12:44:39):3 years Older (correction)\nFreddie(12:44:42):Okay sure - I appreciate where you're coming from as I would feel the same way in your shoes. We do have a customer care team who do look at the prices of renewals. I can pass you over to them if you like? :)\nVisitor--950439497-6640(12:45:51):Okay,\nFreddie(12:47:03):Sorry bear with me, its rather busy at the moment so Im just waiting for an advisor to be available\nVisitor--950439497-6640(12:47:34):I'll wait\nFreddie(12:48:30):Thank you\nElliot(12:51:06):Hi, you’re through to Elliot in Home Services\nVisitor--950439497-6640(12:51:49):Hi Elliot, I'm Andrea and I need to discuss a renewal for Homecase 400 renewal quote which is wholly unacceptable\nElliot(12:52:08):Hi Andrea, I can certainly help you with this today\nElliot(12:52:19):Do bear with me whilst I load up your account\nElliot(12:54:26):I can see that you have our Homecare 400, covering your boiler, central heating, plumbing and drains and home electrics \nElliot(12:54:53):I'll take you through a few ways we can lower your renewal quote\nElliot(12:54:57):Are you happy with your level of cover or would you\nconsider removing part of your agreement to bring down the cost?\nVisitor--950439497-6640(12:55:59):I want the same cover but looking for paying circa £180. I don't think this is an unfair price based on boiler age and what I had previously paid at another premise for a much older boiler\nElliot(12:58:08):Okay I appreciate that, I’ll see what I\ncan do about the price if we keep your level of cover as it is. I’ll just be 2-3 minutes.<br />\nElliot(13:04:16):Thank you for waiting. I can certainly apply a discount to your agreement which would reduce your monthly cost to £18.51\nVisitor--950439497-6640(13:06:34):That is still a 13% increase when inflation is almost zero and forecasted to be negative shortly. I have no increase in income so I need to get a lower agreement, Can you get down to £15 per month\nElliot(13:08:40):I understand, but do keep in mind that your agreement price is not based on solely on annual changes in inflation, many more factors contribute to your price changes. Let me see if I can do any more with reducing the price for you.\nVisitor--950439497-6640(13:09:49):I realise that but I do not have an old boiler and paid less at my last home for a boiler in excess of ten years old\nElliot(13:11:52):I understand, however the age of the boiler does not always correlate with the price of cover - a newer boiler may cost more for us to cover as the parts for it cost more.\nVisitor--950439497-6640(13:13:00):So do I need to consider changing providers?\nElliot(13:13:13):I'm looking into reducing your pricing now for you\nVisitor--950439497-6640(13:13:58):Thanks Elliot, I appreciate your help\nElliot(13:14:15):I do have the option to offer you our highest % of discount, which would reduce your monthly cost to £17.43 and I can leave your level of cover unchanged\nVisitor--950439497-6640(13:16:32):Nearly of interest, do you have a team leader that can approve a slightly better deal for me as I would prefer to stay with you\nElliot(13:18:08):I'm afraid this is the highest % of discount that anyone could offer you I'm afraid, we don't have the option to go any higher even with the approval of a team leader. If we're aiming to get your price closer to £15, we may need to look into reducing your level of cover or changing your level of cover you see\nElliot(13:21:55):Are you still there?\nElliot(13:23:19):<i>Due\nto inactivity this session will now end but. If you need any more help, please\nvisit us on web chat again and we will be more than happy to help.\nAlternatively you can call us anytime on 0800 048 1000.</i>\nVisitor--950439497-6640(13:23:20):Hi Elliot, I am being very honest with you when I say that my income isn't going up, in fact I anticipate a reduction which is making it very tight for me. The small increase of just over 6% sounds low but to reduce at the cost of cover I am not sure I can deal with. I know you are not far away on price and may not be able to help in a reduction to my target but I need to consider what to do next. Are you sure you can't trim a little more before I have to look what's on the market (I haven't looked yet so not sure what is out there).\n"

It also doesn’t matter which kitchen\nappliance cover needs repairing or how long the repair takes, the price is\nstill fixed.\nGemma(17:22:02):Option 2 is our Repair & Cover agreement where you\npay £99 for us to repair this initial fault, then it’s £2.35 per month to cover the Hob against future\nbreakdowns. You can also cover additional kitchen appliances under this policy\nas well, do let me know if you would like me to provide the cost to include\nthese.\nVisitor--950439497-9372(17:22:37):so £145 fixed price, including unlimited parts and labour?\nGemma(17:23:48):Yes the one off price includes parts and labour costs for the repair.\nVisitor--950439497-9372(17:25:00):If I take out the policy does that become part of the HomeCare policy , in terms of annual start and end dates?\nVisitor--950439497-9372(17:25:07):or a second policy with different dates?\nGemma(17:26:44):This would be added to your existing agreement so the renewal would be on the same date as your current cover.\nVisitor--950439497-9372(17:27:25):ok I think the existing policy expires this month doesn't it?\nGemma(17:31:59):Yes the expiry date is on the 28th August 2016\nGemma(17:32:46):We can add on the hob for you it would also be covered for the next year. I can arrange a call back from our HomeCare team if you would liek to add this on to the agreement?\nVisitor--950439497-9372(17:33:30):right OK\nVisitor--950439497-9372(17:33:41):Do I need to book the repair with them then?\nGemma(17:34:08):Yes they can arrange the repair after this has been set up for you.\nVisitor--950439497-9372(17:34:20):I think I am covered for an annual boiler service and gas safety cert, is that correct?\nGemma(17:35:22):Yes your agreement cover an annual service on the boiler and a landlords gas safety certificate on the hob and boiler\nVisitor--950439497-9372(17:35:54):OK do I need to book those through the homecare team ?\nVisitor--950439497-9372(17:36:12):is it just easier to talk to the homecare team?\nGemma(17:38:23):Yes I can arrange a call back from our landlords team to get this all arranged for you, can I take your phone number please?\nVisitor--950439497-9372(17:38:34):07711 760006\nVisitor--950439497-9372(17:38:41):Is there a number that I can call them on?\nGemma(17:39:02):Thank you I have passed your details on to our landlords team and they will give you a call back in the next 15 minutes.

Was looking for info on this on the British Gas website.  Do you know about it please?\nAyaan(13:00:45):Yes, I'd be more than happy to assist, what would you like to know?\nVisitor--950439497-6808(13:01:17):If I change my meter at home through British Gas, will I get free electricity on weekends?\nAyaan(13:01:29):Are you currently an existing customer? \nVisitor--950439497-6808(13:01:35):Yes\nAyaan(13:02:48):Okay, so if you were to change your smart meter and you're eligible for this, you would still need to have some further eligibility checks done for the HomeEnergy FreeTime tariff as there are some other criteria's with this. \nAyaan(13:03:37):They are as follows;<br />\n<br />\nHave a smart meter (or be eligible)<br />\nHave credit meters (not available to pay as you go customers)<br />\nPay via direct debit (monthly) or cash/cheque<br />\nHave an online account<br />\nHave both fuels with us. \nVisitor--950439497-6808(13:04:24):Ok, looks possible then.  We usually settle our account 3 monthly by direct debit but we could change to monthly.\nAyaan(13:04:55):Great, so all you would really need is to check if you'd be eligible for a smart meter, and if you like I'd be happy to run the checks for you if you like? \nVisitor--950439497-6808(13:05:53):Its OK, I already know that we are eligible and have arranged installation for September.  Just wanted to find out about the free electricity.  thanks for your help.  Carole\nAyaan(13:06:19):Oh that's brilliant then, on the day of installation, give it a day or two for the systems to update. \nAyaan(13:06:39):Then go on to your online account and you'll be able to change your tariff online and see if the HomeEnergy FreeTime tariff is there for you.\nAyaan(13:06:54):Or feel free to call us on 0800 048 0202 (free from landlines and mobiles). \nVisitor--950439497-6808(13:07:00):thank you very much.

It might be a fault with your app personally, and I'm not technically trained to know if it is or not. I can transfer you through now to our technical team and they can have a look into it and explain the issue for you.\nVisitor--950439519-5534(08:26:15):Well it's not an issue with my phone it's an issue with your app - you only show 4 icons instead of 5 when you have the kitchen plan - please ask you IT department to investigate this on their own devices \nVisitor--950439519-5534(08:26:52):Are you still there?\nHayley(08:27:59):I have spoken to my colleagues and they have advised that in your case because it is a duel fuel cooker, the way our job booking works is slightly different and our app cannot establish if it's the gas or electric part of the cooker that we need to book the breakdown for.\nHayley(08:28:22):This is why it doesn't show on the app or online to book the appointment for it. If you have another fault with it you can contact us via webchat to book the appointment for you.\nVisitor--950439519-5534(08:29:32):But that defeats the object can they not put both the electric cooker and gas hob icon as mentioned before it took nearly 24 hours to book a slot - and has still annoyed thus contacting you now?\nVisitor--950439519-5534(08:30:26):Please can I raise a formal complaint about this as my time is precious and was totally wasted.\nHayley(08:32:20):We are unable to do that because that would mean you had two seperate appliances rather than the cooker as one and then your payments would not be correct.\nHayley(08:32:56):I can log a complaint on the system for you and the feedback will be sent to our customer relations team.\nVisitor--950439519-5534(08:33:32):Yes please as the app is meant to help to customer and that occasion was no help at all.\nHayley(08:33:39):Yes I will log that for you.\nVisitor--950439519-5534(08:33:48):Thanks Hayley\nHayley(08:34:13):Is there anything else I can help with today?\nVisitor--950439519-5534(08:34:19):You have my email address for correspondence only please? \nVisitor--950439519-5534(08:35:44):No thanks for you help Hayley?\nHayley(08:35:46):I won't be passing this complaint to customer relations for them to contact you back, I will raise the complaint and log it on the system, so that it can be tracked \nVisitor--950439519-5534(08:35:55):Jaethornton@hotmail.com\nVisitor--950439519-5534(08:36:45):But I would like them to contact me also as its not acceptable to offer an app that half works?\nHayley(08:37:34):No problem. I will pass this on for you.\nVisitor--950439519-5534(08:37:45):Thanks Hayley\n"

How can I help today?\nVisitor--950439520-6190(10:46:52):Hello can I put my FIT number in on line?\nMatt(10:47:28):It's not something we deal with in Energy Efficiency, I'll just have a quick check if you're OK to hang one with me a moment.\nVisitor--950439520-6190(10:49:29):Sorry Matt, I M looking at the smart meter I think this w ill be imposed on us soon so what's it all about? Thanks Ron\nMatt(10:49:58):\nIt looks like you can put your readings in here, if you're already registered for the Feed In Tariff: <a\n  href=\"http://www.britishgas.co.uk/fitreads\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.britishgas.co.uk/fitreads</a>\nMatt(10:51:16):The existing generation of Smart Meters aren't compatible with a solar panel installation at a home, so it will be a year or two before the new ones come out. It will basically send us your readings when needed & will show you what your using in the property in real time.\nVisitor--950439520-6190(10:51:38):I do that already on line are you saying you can just type the read I vs into the smart meter?\nVisitor--950439520-6190(10:52:59):Your opinion o n only Are they worth having or are they some sort of spy?\nMatt(10:53:07):The Smart meter will take out the need to put in your electric and gas meter reads online, they will be sent straight from the meter. You'd still need to put your FiT reads in as usual\nMatt(10:53:51):They make life a lot easier & the monitor does make it easier to keep an eye on your usage. They have no spy facilities as far as I'm aware :)\nVisitor--950439520-6190(10:54:04):OK, should I wait until the new meters come out?\nMatt(10:55:16):I would, it confuses the current meter technology if you're generating electric with solar panels so the in home monitor will not work. As you're registered for the FiT with us, the Smart team will be aware and will contact you once the new generation of meters have been tested and roll out begins\nVisitor--950439520-6190(10:56:49):Thanks Matt I will do just that. Thank You.\nMatt(10:57:04):No problem, is there anything else I can have a look at for you today?\nVisitor--950439520-6190(10:58:17):No, Th a 's Well,for the advice. Ron\nVisitor--950439520-6190(10:58:36):Well yes there is\nVisitor--950439520-6190(11:01:09):I have sent FIT reading some months ago they told us they would be late paying. They have this morning asked for FIT readings and we have still not been p a I'd for the first lot.\nMatt(11:02:38):I don't have access to their systems, but I wasn't aware of any problems at the moment.  They don't have any webchat facilities, but if you can give them a call on 0800 072 8283 they'll be able to have a look into that for you\nVisitor--950439520-6190(11:03:51):Thanks Matt I,'ll do that Thaksin you that's it.\nMatt(11:04:12):In that case thanks for chatting with me today, Ron.

I would recommend calling our Smart Homes team on 0800 980 6121 and they will be able to book in a smart meter exchange for you manually. \nVisitor--950439497-5909(09:48:46):Ok will do thanks for your help\nRhydian(09:49:12):You're welcome. \nRhydian(09:49:20):Have a nice day Pam. \nVisitor--950439497-5909(09:49:32):You too \n",

As I have only just discovered.\nFaheem(09:03:28):I understand, that's not a problem. Just to confirm would you consider keeping ourselves for your plumbing and drains if we were able to reduce the cost of your cover?\nVisitor--950439497-5701(09:04:42):How much would the whole cover be Faheem?\nFaheem(09:05:50):Currently you're paying £33.97 a month, for your cover which is Central Heating Cover & Plumbing & Drains. I can take a look into reducing the cost of your cover, if you would like to check that? <br />\n<b><u /></b>\nVisitor--950439497-5701(09:06:55):Ok. Could you also check and see if you service Aga ovens. Thanks\nFaheem(09:07:29):I will see what I can do for you, I will generate some quotes for you now. \nFaheem(09:07:51):Just to let you know we don't service AGA ovens anymore, it was something that we used to offer, but unfortunately we do not offer this service anymore \nFaheem(09:07:56):I will get some quotes for you \nFaheem(09:09:43):You have the option of adding a £50 to your Plumbing & Drains Cover, which would bring your agreement down to £27.93. Your central heating cover will remain the same without an excess. Is this something you would consider to go ahead with? \nFaheem(09:12:03):£50 excess*\nVisitor--950439497-5701(09:12:59):Thanks for your help Faheem, but I would like to cancel my plumbing and drains and stay with just my original central  heating cover....could you tell how much this would be please.\nFaheem(09:13:43):I understand, I will provide you with your updated price plan now for removing your plumbing and drains\nVisitor--950439497-5701(09:13:58):Thankyou\nFaheem(09:16:33):To confirm, your new annual price is £307.99. Your next direct\ndebit will be £24.00 on 20th August 2016 and then £24.00 each month after. Your outstanding\nbalance is £240.00. These prices include Insurance\nPremium Tax. This price will run up until your next renewal date on 14th June 2017.\nFaheem(09:16:44):Just to remind you, you have Central Heating Cover & Plumbing & Drains Cover with us. Just to confirm that you will no longer be covered under the Plumbing & Drains cover from 10th August 2016.\nFaheem(09:17:51):Your Central Heating Cover will continue. Could I confirm that you're happy to go ahead with this? \nVisitor--950439497-5701(09:19:54):That still seems expensive. it seems to have doubled in price since we first started... is that the standard price for everyone.\nFaheem(09:20:49):Your price will\nvary year to year due to a number of factors which are used to determine your\nindividual pricing. These include the make, model, and age of your boiler, as\nwell as the size of your property and also your boiler and breakdown history\nfor the past two years and previous discount history. This means that the price\nof your cover is unique to you and is line with what we've calculated to be a\nfair cost to cover you.\nVisitor--950439497-5701(09:21:51):Ok that's fine.\nFaheem(09:22:25):That's great. Just to remind you for your remaining cover which is Homecare 200\nFaheem(09:22:33):This meets the demands and needs of those who wish to look after their gas\ncentral heating system and protect against the cost of future repairs and\nincludes an Annual Service to make sure the boiler is working safely and\nefficiently.\nFaheem(09:22:40):Would you like me to make you aware of the Features,\nBenefits, Limitations and Exclusions of your policy? <b><u /></b>\nVisitor--950439497-5701(09:23:09):No it's ok Faheem.\nFaheem(09:23:53):Thanks. Just lastly - You\nwill receive confirmation including full terms and conditions via post/email in\nthe next 7 working days including the price and your payment schedule.

I can see that she's had to escalate the issue affecting the change of tariff on your account. As soon as\nshe's received an update about this she’ll be contacting you directly. She's advised this will be no later than 18 August 2016.\nVisitor--950439520-6118(10:41:12):I'm starting to get abit miffed though now, I keep getting told I will be called at a certain time, which I do.  But then I get told I will have to wait for another 3 weeks.  I only wanted my tariffs changing, surely that's an easy job, and its took like 6 weeks now and it still hasn't changed\nAndrew(10:44:24):I'm very sorry that we're having difficulties applying this tariff for you Lee. Please be assured Kerry is following the correct procedure in getting this resolved or you. I know Kerry personally and you can be assured that she's an experienced complaints manager and her notes fully advise what steps she's taking to get this fixed for you.\nAndrew(10:44:52):Would you like me to ask Kerry to get back in touch with you?\nVisitor--950439520-6118(10:46:02):Its not Kerry I am aiming my complaint at, I'm sure she is following procedure.  But that procedure surely isn't good enough that it takes over 6 weeks to change a customers tariff?\nAndrew(10:48:31):I understand Lee. It's a very new tariff and so to look after any issues we've got a dedicated team fixing any faults which is why we've escalated your details to them. Please be assured that the tariff and savings you're owed will be backdated to you once this matter is fixed.\nVisitor--950439520-6118(10:49:23):Does the tariff not go through testing before it's published to the general public?\nAndrew(10:51:34):All our products and services do go through testing. Sometimes other unexpected things can go wrong which has happened in this case.\nVisitor--950439520-6118(10:52:50):what's actually the problem? and why is it taking so long?\nAndrew(10:56:49):From Kerry's notes they tell me that the tariff you've applied for has been put on the gas account but not the electricity account. Our systems are contradicting each other when we need them to be correct so your charged correctly and that you get the savings your due.\nVisitor--950439520-6118(10:58:06):So is there a timescale on when this will be fixed?\nAndrew(11:00:25):At the moment I'm sorry their isn't a timescale although Kerry as your case handler will be looking after your case for you and chasing thing sup with the relevant teams until it's completely resolved for you.\nVisitor--950439520-6118(11:01:26):IS this just my tariff that is affected?\nAndrew(11:02:38):According to Kerry's notes yes it's only the tariff affected for you.\nAndrew(11:06:41):I'll be adding a full set of notes and a transcript of this WebChat  to your complaint case. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\nAndrew(11:09:51):Are you still there Lee?\nAndrew(11:11:57):This chat will end in 60 seconds due to inactivity.  Please send a message if you want to continue.\nAndrew(11:14:13):I haven’t heard back from you so this chat is closing now. If you still need help, please talk to us again or call 0800 294 3124 and we’ll be happy to help.\n"

I'll give you the code now.... (in a few seconds anyway)...\nAndy(14:38:55):The code for the gas payment is<b> 82383886104429389051</b>\nAndy(14:39:28):I'm guessing you already know the buttons to press to put that code in - yeah?\nVisitor--950439521-7474(14:40:38):Yeah but still want it sorting that I don't do this \nAndy(14:40:58):Absolutely - I'll go through that with you now.\nAndy(14:42:01):The issue you're having is caused by the signals we're sending to the meter not actually reaching the hub where the signals are received.  the first thing i want to do is to make sure the hub is set up properly.  Are you home just now?\nVisitor--950439521-7474(14:42:25):Yea\nAndy(14:43:21):ok.  beside the electricity meter there's a white box with 3 lights on - triangle-shaped. Can you please tell me if any of the lights are lit up red or are off?\nVisitor--950439521-7474(14:45:03):The top 2 are flashing green and bottom one is just green \nAndy(14:45:38):All green though - that's ok.  Thanks Emma.\nAndy(14:45:53):Does your Smart monitor display both gas and electricity for you?\nVisitor--950439521-7474(14:46:13):Yes \nAndy(14:47:59):Again, that's a good sign. I'm trying to establish why you're payment signals aren't hitting the meter. Eliminating the usual causes.  I'm gong to have a more in-depth look at the Smart meter information that's being sent to your meter to see if I can get an idea what's wrong.  Are you alright to give mne a few minutes to do that?\nAndy(14:48:04):*me*\nVisitor--950439521-7474(14:48:26):Yeah \nAndy(14:48:45):Thanks.  I'll be back as quickly as possible for you...\nAndy(14:56:58):Hi Emma - sorry to have kept you waiting\nVisitor--950439521-7474(14:57:09):It's ok\nAndy(14:57:57):Appreciate that - thanks.  I've gone right into the system to try to find the issue. I'll tell you where we're at with this...\nAndy(14:59:55):The meters, monitor and hub in your property are fine - all are working. The payment signals we've sent are also ok.  the issue is somewhere in the middle of those 2 things.  The signals we're sending are simply not getting through to the hub with the lights on. I'll tell you next what we're gong to do about that...\nAndy(15:00:15):*going*\nAndy(15:02:05):I'm reporting this issue to our Smart tech team.  They'll investigate to see if other Smart customers in your area are also being affected by this and if the cause of the signal failure is local. Once that's been done, , if the cause can be found we'll take the steps to get the signals to hit the meter. ok so far?\nVisitor--950439521-7474(15:02:34):Ok\nAndy(15:02:46):Here's what we advise for the moment...\nAndy(15:06:04):It might be 2 or 3 weeks before we have a concrete answer to the cause of the problem. For you it would mean having to continue manually inputting the codes.  If the result in inconclusive it would mean that the Smart meters may not be workable in your property. I'm gong to suggest that you leave it for 2 weeks (3 if you're really patient). If the fault has been resolved during that period you'll know as your payments will go straight to the meter as they should.  If after 2 (3) weeks your paments are still not hitting we'd look to remove the Smart meters.  Are you gong to be able to handle another couple of weeks putting the codes in by hand?\nAndy(15:06:31):*I can't seem to type the word 'going'*\nVisitor--950439521-7474(15:07:52):How can all a sudden they aren't suitable I've had them ages !??\nVisitor--950439521-7474(15:08:44):My mum live in same area and hers are ok\nAndy(15:10:25):It's something we're coming across where signals which were reaching meters perfectly before, suddenly stop hitting the hub - it could be a change in the area (something blocking signals) or it could be a change in the strength of the signal to your wifi - our tech team will do a thorough investigation and obviously we'll try to get your meters working as they should as quickly as we can (if we can). \nAndy(15:11:22):The only other thing I could do today is to arrange for the Smart meters to be removed as soon as possible for you.  What are you thinking? Are you ok to persevere for another couple of weeks like this Emma?\nVisitor--950439521-7474(15:14:55):I thinking that I was talked into these meters in which British Gas said everyone will soon have smart meters then to have u say I need them changing back. I'll wait a few weeks but I'm really not happy about all this. The problem is British Gas rushed into putting these in people homes before trying them properly. \nAndy(15:17:45):I'll register your complain on your account about this Emma. I completely understand what you're saying there.  We're not fitting them as standard for that reason.

How can I help you today?\nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:20:02):Ive currently got HomeCare 400 can you tell me wht the monthly cost is rising so high?\nHayley(15:20:11):Is that your renewal?\nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:20:18):yes\nHayley(15:20:23):Our Homecare products are insurance based which\nmeans that the pricing will be calculated by considering a number of factors.\nThese can include the number of call outs you’ve had, the make, model and age\nof the appliance, your location in the UK etc. This means that the price of\nyour cover is unique to you and your property.\nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:22:36):the one call out was due to your engineer wrongly attributing a problem (that only he could see) to methane. The second engineer serviced the boiler and found no methane problems.\nHayley(15:22:50):I see,\nHayley(15:23:14):What I will do is pop you through to our customer care department, and they will discuss your renewal price further with you.\nHayley(15:23:39): We\nhaven't currently got anyone available on webchat to do this for you, you can\neither contact them later or you can call our customer care team on 0800 048\n1000. I can also arrange a call back for you within 48 working hours if you\nprefer? \nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:23:44):The boiler is obviously only one year older from our last renewal so why has the cost risen so much?\nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:25:28):Is that it then??\nHayley(15:25:49):I will transfer you through to our customer care department now\nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:26:31):Anybody there?\nAshley(15:27:08):Hi, sorry for the delay - I was just reading the previous chat notes. You are through to Ashley\nAshley(15:27:28):Let me take your details and I can check on the renewal price for you\nAshley(15:27:33):May I take the address and postcode and your name, or\nyour account number and your name to access the HomeCare account? And can you\nconfirm if you are the account holder please?\nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:28:46):2 Stafford Road\nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:28:53):Preston\nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:29:04):PR!6LB\nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:29:18):I am the account holder\nAshley(15:29:42):Ok thanks, could I just get you the check that postcode please, and can I take your name?\nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:30:06):Sorry PR1 6LB Antony Hindle\nAshley(15:30:33):Brilliant thanks very much Antony, I'm just getting into the account now, I won't be long...\nAshley(15:32:53):Thanks for your patience Antony, just to remind you, you have HomeCare 400 with us. This includes cover for the boiler, central heating, plumbing, drains and electrics. Let me ask a couple of\nquestions in order to help you with this enquiry<br />\nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:33:19):ok go on\nAshley(15:33:27):Thanks, are you happy with your level of cover or would you\nconsider removing part of your agreement to bring down the cost?\nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:33:47):no I don't want less cover\nAshley(15:33:58):Thank you,\nwould amending the excess on your cover be something you would like to do at\nall?\nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:35:01):what excess? Excess on a service contract?\nAshley(15:35:51):Thanks, yes you could lower the monthly cost of your cover by adding an excess for repairs. This would mean that you would pay £50 for each repair and pay a lower monthly premium\nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:36:09):What I need to know is why it is rising by 6.93 per month?\nAshley(15:37:02):Ok thanks, the prices online are set for the first year,\nafter the first year the price will vary depending on the age and make/model of\nthe boiler, size of the system, your exact location and the type of system. \nAshley(15:37:53):I can review the price of your renewal now to see if we can keep the cover the same and look at lowering the price for you if you like?\nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:37:54):This is not a one year old relationship! Why so much this time?\nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:38:37):And if I wanted to gamble with £50  I would go to Ladbrokes\nAshley(15:38:58):I can review the price of your renewal now to see if we can keep the cover the same and look at lowering the price for you if you like? \nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:39:19):That would be a start. Thanks.\nAshley(15:41:48):Thank you, your renewal has come in at around £38.81 per month, I can offer a 10% discount on the following years cover which would bring your payments down to around £34.97 per month. If you would like to go ahead with this I can arrange that for you now, this would be keeping the cover the same - HomeCare 400 with an annual service and no excess to pay for repairs\nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:42:42):That's very civil of you. Thanks.\nAshley(15:43:21):Thanks Antony, I can apply that discount for you now if you wanted to go ahead?\nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:43:31):Yes please\nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:43:55):Will I get a new statement?\nAshley(15:44:09):Thank you, yes you will, please stay on\nthe chat whilst I confirm the changes for you…<br />\nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:44:20):Ok\nAshley(15:46:10):To confirm, your new annual price is £417.66. Your first direct\ndebit will be £34.97 on 18th August 2016 and then £34.79 each month after. These prices include the discount I have applied, as well as\nInsurance Premium Tax. This price will run for 12 months from your renewal date\non 17th August 2016 until 16th August 2017.<b />\nAshley(15:46:19):Just to confirm - are you happy to go ahead\nwith this?\nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:46:43):yes thanks\nAshley(15:46:51):Thanks Antony and lastly - You\nwill receive confirmation including full terms and conditions via post/email in\nthe next 7 working days including the price and your payment schedule. These\ndocuments are important so please have a read of the paperwork once received to\nmake sure everything is okay. You have 14 days from your renewal date to cancel\nor change your mind and you will receive a full refund provided we haven’t done\nany work.\nAshley(15:47:01):That’s all done\nfor you now, is there anything else I can help you with today?\nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:47:39):Yes there is. Could you give me a quote for kitchen appliances cover?\nAshley(15:48:26):Thanks, yes certainly I can give you the details of the Kitchen Appliance cover and the prices for that too from here too...\nAshley(15:48:48):The Kitchen Appliance Cover includes parts and labour for repairs to\nyour kitchen appliances. Your appliances must be in good working order when you\ntake out this cover as there is a 14 day waiting period before you can make a claim, after\nthis you are covered for unlimited repairs.\nAshley(15:49:08):We cover\nindividual appliances as well as packages of 3, 5 or 9 appliances.\nAshley(15:49:19):We can offer you cover for:\n\n<br />\n3 appliances for £12.50 per month with no excess or £6.75 per\nmonth with a £60 excess  \n\n<br />\n5 appliances for £16.00 per month with no excess or £9.10 per\nmonth with a £60 excess\n\n<br />\n9 appliances for £20.00 per month with no excess or £12.50 per\nmonth with a £60 excess \nAshley(15:50:06):<a href=\"http://bit.ly/26x2eJo\" target=\"_blank\">Please click here for more on the Kitchen Appliance Cover</a>\nVisitor--950439520-8052(15:50:49):How much per month to cover a Zanussi dishwasher,  Indesit washing machine and Hotpoint fridge/freezer - is that £12.50 per month?\nAshley(15:52:13):Thanks, yes that is correct £12.50 per month for those 3 appliances.

Having recently checked my direct debits it seems that I have been charged the origiban price as first quoted, rather than a reduced price.\nFreddie(19:55:29):Ahh right I see! Sorry to hear about this. So yes I can see that you did speak to someone in September about this. So the way to resolve this as quickly as possible is to contact our customer care team. They deal with looking at the prices of homecare accounts and seeing what we can do to reduce the cost. This is the team you would have spoken to back in september. I would advise to contact them on 0800 294 9123, alternative they are also on webchat. But at the moment they are currently unavailable. They will be open from 7am tomorrow though :)\nVisitor--950439523-11199(19:57:42):Thanks Freddie.......just following what I was asked to do via the email!!!\nFreddie(19:57:59):Haha Im sorry its taken so long!

How can I help you today?\nVisitor--950439522-6455(11:52:17):Hi Mo I am trying to book an engineer to come and look at my gas hob ignition button as it is stuck and wont ignite,  I cant get an appointment on line.  Can you help please?\nMohan(11:52:37):Sure, can you confirm your address and postcode please?\nVisitor--950439522-6455(11:52:53):55 Donnington Road, HA3 0NB\nMohan(11:54:08):Thanks. Can you confirm your name please?\nVisitor--950439522-6455(11:54:17):mrs thalia aherne\nMohan(11:55:02):Thank you Thalia. I have the details now. Is it just a fault with the ignition button? Or have you noticed any issue with the hob?\nVisitor--950439522-6455(11:55:51):Just the ignition button.  I can light all the rings with a match, but don't like doing it that way, I like to just press the ignition button to get the spark!!\nMohan(11:56:39):I understand. I have had a look at the agreement, and the hob is only set up for the safety checks Thalia. This wouldn't cover a repair.\nVisitor--950439522-6455(11:57:41):Oh ok, I didn't know that.  Thanks for letting me know.  Better stock up with matches then!!\nMohan(11:57:42):We can still carry out a repair, either under a repair and cover agreement or a one off repair. I will make you aware of both options:\nMohan(11:57:54):Option 1 is a one off repair for £145 which includes the\ncost of parts, labour and call out. It also doesn’t matter which kitchen appliance\nneeds repairing or how long the repair takes, the price is still fixed.\nMohan(11:58:31):Option 2 is our Repair & Cover agreement where you\npay £99 for us to repair this initial fault, then it’s £2.35 per month to cover the gas hob against future\nbreakdowns. You can also cover additional kitchen appliances under this policy\nas well, do let me know if you would like me to provide the cost to include\nthese.\nVisitor--950439522-6455(11:59:31):My partner said he thinks its grease got under the ignition button.  He said he will remove it and clean it, if it still doesn't ignite, I will consider one of the above options.  Thanx for your help Mo!\nMohan(11:59:45):You're welcome. Enjoy the rest of your afternoon!\n"

I am an EDF customer. I was really upset by the first bill for £1088 and still upset at being asked to pay £10.42 for gas that has not been used. I think I deserve compensation as well as an apology. This is a disgraceful way to treat anyone. Yes i will be using EDF but have not yet moved in. I do own the property.\nTracy(12:03:24):I'm so sorry for the original large bill Wilma, as a goodwill gesture I'll add a credit to the account to clear the balance so you don't have to pay anything.\nVisitor--950439519-6466(12:04:55):Thank you Tracy. That is good. I have enough to worry about with moving without British Gas upsetting me. Can you send an email to confirm there is nothing owing. \nTracy(12:05:58):Of course I can Wilma, I'll get this sent to you today.  Once the email has been sent confirming nothing is owing, are you happy for me to close the complaint?\nVisitor--950439519-6466(12:07:09):Yes. That's ok. Unless you can add a weekend break somewhere quiet.

Otherwise, you can stick with the pay as you go meter you have and once we can upgrade you to smart we will let you know.\nVisitor--950439522-7388(14:27:08):Ok Thank  You \n",

Please give me a moment,\nwhile I check your account details.\nSai(14:23:21):Thanks for waiting.\nSai(14:24:36):I see there is an issue with our billing system.\nSai(14:24:47):Please be assured, I've now arranged to rectify the issue.\nSai(14:25:04):Once the issue is resolved you'll be able to manage Direct Debit online without any issues.\nSai(14:28:17):I'll also record your dissatisfaction as a complaint.\nSai(14:28:33):And send you the complaint handling procedure via email once this chat ends.\nSai(14:28:48):And keep the complaint open until the issue is resolved for you.\nVisitor--950439519-7375(14:29:25):with all due respect, i have been told this for the last 8 months.... and it still isn't resolved. at one point, it was telling me i was likley to owe you £1600 at the end of my plan then is all got sorted but since then i haven't been able to view anything. i have also spoken to a number of people regarding this and a number of other issues as i was not benefitting from dual fuel discount until this month (for the last 4 years) i need to keep track of my direct debit so i can increase/decrease my payments accordingly and i am unable to do that due to a billing error that is taking an awfully long time to fix !\nSai(14:30:24):I agree with your completely and understand your concern.\nSai(14:30:35):I really appreciate your patience. \nSai(14:30:59):You should get the benefit of dual fuel discount.\nSai(14:31:36):It will be shown on your electricity bill.\nSai(14:32:28):Your payments are on track.\nSai(14:32:35):So you need not have to worry.\nSai(14:34:03):We review your payments regularly.\nSai(14:34:31):We review your account regularly, usually\ntwice a year. We project how much gas you’ll use over a year, based on\nprevious consumption, and set a monthly payment amount. \nSai(14:34:56):how much gas and electricity*\nSai(14:35:06):If it appears that your monthly installments are too high or low we will\nof course reduce or increase your payments at the time of review.\nSai(14:35:40):We're next due to review your payments in late September 2016.\nSai(14:36:10):I see earlier you were unable to manage Direct debit due to an issue with our Billing system.\nSai(14:36:33):However, now one of the reason is your payment review.\nSai(14:37:01):Once the review is done, you'll be able to manage Direct Debit fully online without any issues.\nSai(14:37:44):Our system is designed in such a way that it won't allow our customers to manage Direct Debit online if we're due to review the payments.\nVisitor--950439519-7375(14:38:27):i have only had my account reviewed in january,  april and then my electricity AGAIN in june. there appears to be a system error because i am on monthly billing that my electricity seems to be always being reviewed . it was reviewed in january, april and then again in JUNE and now in September ????\nSai(14:39:57):The review is usually done twice in a year.\nSai(14:40:27):I agree that the review was been done in the month of June 2016.\nSai(14:40:48):This shouldn't happen.\nSai(14:41:32):We'll need to update our billing system.\nSai(14:41:48):I've already kept a note on your account and will keep the complaint.\nSai(14:42:05):will keep the complaint open until it s resolved for you.\nSai(14:42:12):for you*\nVisitor--950439519-7375(14:42:12):i know but there is a problem with my electricity account meaning its being reviewed more often than it needs to be. it seems to be ending my plan every couple of months and i don't understand why this is. i spoke to a gentleman on the phone prior to my holiday and he said the same, it shouldnt be happening. but he couldn't understand why t was either and we are no further down the line of rectifying the issue.\nSai(14:42:36):This is the reason, you're not been able to manage electricity online.\nSai(14:43:11):I'll pass your account details to our specialist team.\nSai(14:43:30):They,ll work on the issue and try to resolve it as soon as possible.\nSai(14:43:38):Once it is resolved, they'll get back to me.\nSai(14:43:46):I'll then email you with an update.\nSai(14:43:53):Please

resolved for you.\nVisitor--950439519-7375(14:47:18):i think 8 months is patience enough. i will continue to submit my readings on line as i usually would but im becoming increasingly concerned that

New customers receive this price because we\nhave no information to base their price on regardless of the size of the\nproperty or the age of the appliance etc.\n\n<br />\n \n\n<br />\nFrom the 2nd year\nof your agreement, pricing is based individually on factors such as make,\nmodel, and age of the boiler, the size of the property and also your boiler and\nbreakdown history for the past two years and previous discount history. When\nyou first joined British Gas you will have also received the acquisition price\nat that time so as much as I understand the advertisements do show cheaper\nprices - every customer is treated fairly.\nVisitor--950439520-9925(18:13:09):OK Thanks we have to look at every penny when you are on a pension\n"

I think this quote is less than my renewal quote.\nFreddie(14:30:58):Okay sure - So what would you like to know? Your level of cover?\nVisitor--950439520-7510(14:32:11):i am comparing prices with other providers and am surprised i can get a cheaper than renewal from you online\nVisitor--950439520-7510(14:33:11):will you honour the online quote for my renewal\nFreddie(14:33:53):Yes, I can explain why the prices online are cheaper than what you currently have. First of all there is a 10% discount for new customers online. Do keep in mind\nthat the prices we advertise are the acquisition prices for the 1st year only\nas an introduction to the company. New customers receive this price because we\nhave no information to base their price on regardless of the size of the\nproperty or the age of the appliance etc.\n\n<br />\n \n\n<br />\nFrom the 2nd year\nof your agreement, pricing is based individually on factors such as make,\nmodel, and age of the boiler, the size of the property and also your boiler and\nbreakdown history for the past two years and previous discount history. When\nyou first joined British Gas you will have also received the acquisition price\nat that time so as much as I understand the advertisements do show cheaper\nprices - every customer is treated fairly.\nVisitor--950439520-7510(14:35:33):so i would be better being a new customer. thanks i will look at other providers on u switch\nFreddie(14:37:06):No thats not the case - What I was going to suggest is speaking to our customer care team if you are unhappy with the price\nFreddie(14:37:24):You can contact them on 0800 294 9123. They would be able to take a look at your price and see what we can do for you\nVisitor--950439520-7510(14:37:51):thanks i will do that\nFreddie(14:38:04):No worries\nFreddie(14:38:08):Take care, have a good day\n"

You can take out the HomeCare 2 online to get a 10% discount and that would cover you for the central heating then add the gas appliance cover on by phoning us and then you would get a 15% discount on that. \nAshley(15:18:07):Can you see where the HomeCare 2 is online?\nVisitor--950439497-7932(15:20:59):Do I pay for any call outs\nVisitor--950439497-7932(15:21:16):And how much would that be\nAshley(15:22:05):You would be able to choose either a £0 or £60 excess for repairs when you get a quote online for the homeCare 2 and over the phone for the gas appliance cover.\nVisitor--950439497-7932(15:22:38):I don't want to pay for call outs\nAshley(15:23:16):So that you're aware you can set up both at the same time over the phone but it would mean that you would not get the 10% discount for the HomeCare 2 for setting it up online. \nAshley(15:23:25):Then you can choose the £0 excess option.\nVisitor--950439497-7932(15:23:46):Do I do it on line then\nAshley(15:24:05):Yes, let me find the link for the HomeCare 2 online for you.\nVisitor--950439497-7932(15:24:22):Cheers\nAshley(15:24:26):<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1NCPVoH\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>*HomeCare 2*</i></b></a>\nAshley(15:24:54):You can set this up online and then once you receive your confirmation email call 0800 048 1000 to set add the gas appliance cover.\nAshley(15:25:10):Are you aware that we do offer cover for things like the plumbing, drains and home electrics too?\nVisitor--950439497-7932(15:25:37):Yes but can't afford that\nAshley(15:26:03):Okay, I just wanted to make sure you were aware. \nAshley(15:26:15):Have you been able to click on the homeCare 2 link?\nVisitor--950439497-7932(15:27:41):It's not letting me click on !\nINFO(15:27:44):Visitor has minimized chat\nAshley(15:27:58):Do you have access to a desktop or a laptop at all? \nINFO(15:28:26):Visitor has maximized chat\nINFO(15:28:36):Visitor has minimized chat\nAshley(15:33:57):Have you been able to access that now?\nINFO(15:35:30):Visitor has maximized chat\nVisitor--950439497-7932(15:35:48):Just done t thanks \n"

Your meter takes £1.82 per week automatically for that. The meter takes at total of £5.47 per week from your payments. Last month you put £50.00 in the meter. For the month of July, your charges were £21.88 (approx) so you electricity cost you £28.00 for the month - £7.00 per week or £1.00 per day.\nVisitor--950439520-6607(13:01:56):I'm getting no reply???\nAndy(13:02:22):Do you see this reply Terre?\nVisitor--950439520-6607(13:05:31):Yes\nVisitor--950439520-6607(13:05:37):Now I can\nAndy(13:06:01):I don't know what happened.

We charge you 14.39p per KWH with a standing charge of 26p.  Exactly the same price as a bill customer.\nAndy(13:10:16):It's the lowest Pay AS You Go tariff we have.\nAndy(13:12:06):Once your balance is cleared you'll be spending £14.60 less per month\nVisitor--950439520-6607(13:12:15):Is this the best option for my circumstances and  I'm I on the best possible tariff?\nVisitor--950439520-6607(13:12:34):If not what are the options?\nVisitor--950439520-6607(13:13:38):Hello Andy are u still there?\nAndy(13:13:43):It's the cheapest tariff we have for Pay As You Go. As you have a debt with us we can't offer a credit meter (you have to be 12 months debt free before we would provide credit) so this is the cheapest tariff available to you.\nAndy(13:15:30):There may be other help available though - Have you heard of the Warm Home Discount Terre?\nVisitor--950439520-6607(13:17:50):Heard of it yes\nVisitor--950439520-6607(13:18:07):But didn't get around to look into it\nAndy(13:18:18):The warm Home Discount is a payment from the government which helps customers with the cost of their electricity over the Winter months.

We have solar panels fitted at our property & use the electricity generated by them in daylight hours.  This may explain the lower readings.\nZoe(16:27:49):Ok let me have a look at it see what's going on :)\nZoe(16:27:59):Can i take your account number, full name, full address and date of birth please :)\nVisitor--950439522-8785(16:27:59):Thanks\nVisitor--950439522-8785(16:29:59):Customer ref no 850009095384  Mr Paul Coates 81 Bardney Orton Goldhay Peterborough Cambs PE2 5QQ DOB 05.03.1955\nZoe(16:30:42):Excellent thanks ill just load the account up\nZoe(16:32:10):Can i take the reads you tried to submit please\nVisitor--950439522-8785(16:33:11):Certainly, electric 25948, gas was not questioned\nZoe(16:35:18):Electric has been at a higher read on the bills for a few months\nZoe(16:35:50):let me load the account  up in the back end system i can alter this\nZoe(16:37:09):can i ask when the read was taken also please :)\nVisitor--950439522-8785(16:37:43):The reading was taken yesterday 9th\nZoe(16:38:55):Thanks\nZoe(16:39:43):I dont mean to be quiet im still here just looking in the back system\nZoe(16:42:35):Do you always supply us with the meter reads? its quite far back that it's too high from - reversing the meter reads back to february this year will make it plausible \nVisitor--950439522-8785(16:44:39):No this is the first time I believe, we supply the gas meter reading but the electric has been taken by the meter reading from our outside electric meter\nZoe(16:45:24):Our system says you gave us a read online in may of 26333?\nVisitor--950439522-8785(16:46:50):That's correct, it was the same value as the meter reader's in April from what I can see from our on line account\nZoe(16:47:11):Let me ring the solar panel team to get clarification \nZoe(16:47:24):have you registered them with our feeding tariff team?\nVisitor--950439522-8785(16:48:34):We had them installed FOC under a scheme run by Peterborough council\nZoe(16:49:32):Ok, did you make us aware when they were fitted? as the meter may need to be upgraded to be compatible with the solar panels\nVisitor--950439522-8785(16:52:08):No, we weren't aware we had to, nor were we told to do this.  We assumed all the paperwork was handled by the installers as they took the excess electric produced.  We had free, solar, electric during daylight hours when the panels were operative.  Any electric not used was then collected by them.  I hope this makes sense.\nZoe(16:54:59):Ok so i've just been speaking with the solar team\nZoe(16:57:05):Bear with me\nVisitor--950439522-8785(16:57:26):OK Thanks\nZoe(17:01:33):So, you need to contact G4S and let them know whats happening - the electricity meter isn't compatible with the solar panels, their number is 0800 4081030. Once they've done their bit they'll let us know what they've done and what we need to do\nZoe(17:02:21):As you're not using as much electric as you're generating basically and the meters having a melt down!\nVisitor--950439522-8785(17:03:35):Who is G4S?  The panels were installed by Empower for/under Peterborough council.\nZoe(17:04:10):G4S are the meter operators, they install meters on behalf of suppliers\nVisitor--950439522-8785(17:05:24):OK, I'll give them a call.  How does this leave our bill?\nZoe(17:06:20):Dont worry about that G4S will contact us and update us what to do with it :)\nVisitor--950439522-8785(17:06:54):Many thanks, have a good afternoon\nZoe(17:07:18):YOu too hope all goes well, feel free to contact us with any queries \nZoe(17:07:29):Thanks for chatting with me!

This was done last Tuesday, but 9 days later I am still waiting to hear from your team\nVisitor--950439521-9347(17:14:10):Yes Alex, I am a British gas customer\nAlex(17:15:26):Great, so please be aware that if you have had a new meter fitted then it will take up to 28 days to gather all the information we need from it Dipak and for this to update on our system. This may be why you haven't been contacted yet, although if you could please tell me the nature of the contact you were expecting then I can confirm that for you. \nVisitor--950439521-9347(17:16:14):What info do you need?\nVisitor--950439521-9347(17:16:50):Customer reference number:\n850036885063\nAlex(17:17:44):So, the information would be feeding back to ourselves and the national grid about your new installation this would include things like your meter serial numbers and who your regional distributor was for example.

As that's the case I'd advise waiting until 28 days had passed from your installation date and then getting in contact with us again. Your interest has been registered so if you forget you should be contacted automatically when you become eligible for the upgrade. Is that OK Dipak? \nVisitor--950439521-9347(17:22:15):That will have to do Alex.\nVisitor--950439521-9347(17:22:34):Thanks, and hope to hear from your team once your systems is updates.\nVisitor--950439521-9347(17:22:49):*Updated\nAlex(17:23:32):That's my pleasure, can I help with anything else at all today? \nVisitor--950439521-9347(17:23:56):No that's all.

I have just received an invoice for £50 despite assurances from both the agent on the phone, as well as the engineer who attended our property that we would not receive a invoice for the second visit as it was the same problem as the original fault I.e it was not fixed properly the first time.\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:02:47):I paid the £50 excess when he visited the first time.\nFreddie(18:02:56):Okay sure - So if this is the case and you have been advised this im sure there is just a mistake on our part\nFreddie(18:03:00):As this would have been a recall\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:03:01):Then the same thing happened again.\nFreddie(18:03:17):I will advise I wont be able to look into the job as it is a plumbing job carried out my our dyno team.\nFreddie(18:03:29):But I would advise you to get in contact with them about the excess that was paid\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:03:45):No, I am a customer of British Gas, not Dyno\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:03:59):I paid the excess to BG\nFreddie(18:04:05):What I mean is the work is carried out by Dyno Rod who are a part of British gas correct?\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:04:07):And you have billed me again\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:04:43):Yes so please can you arrange for this invoice to be recalled and for that to be confirmed asap. I'm going on holiday so don't want this to be outstanding please.\nFreddie(18:05:12):Okay, so I am trying to explain to you that because it was a Dyno appointment\nFreddie(18:05:18):I can't see any work carried out by Dyno rod\nFreddie(18:05:30):Therefore I can't investigate that the £50 excess was already paid\nFreddie(18:05:35):And that this should have been a recall\nFreddie(18:05:47):I am only trying to give you the quickest option for you to resolve this\nFreddie(18:05:59):As I won't be able to do anything for you. \nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:06:05):This is not for me to resolve, it is your error!\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:06:21):I was assured by 2 of your colleagues that this would not happen.\nFreddie(18:06:27):Right\nFreddie(18:06:38):Can I have some details please, your full name, first line and post code? :)\nFreddie(18:07:07):I'm going to call Dyno Rod myself to see what they advise\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:07:58):I'm messaging you from the app - acc no 911000273948, house no 73, post code SL6 2DN\nFreddie(18:08:10):Can I have your full name please?\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:08:26):Can you tell me\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:08:37):My first name first please?\nFreddie(18:08:53):I can't do that, for Data Protection reasons I am asking your name.\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:09:31):This is a joke. My complaint now extends to you. Please can you arrange for a manager to call me on 07730 611327, asap?\nFreddie(18:10:23):I don't understand I'm sorry. You advised you are on your app. that doesn't mean I have your details to hand unfortunately.\nFreddie(18:10:44):Thats why I asked for your name, so that I can confirm I am talking to the account holder and therefore can contact Dyno to advise about the recall job\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:12:37):Freddie, I don't really want to deal with you any more - you appear to have forgotten who the paying customer is here and it is your tone and reference to Dyno that has really frustrated me here. BG have made an error and I don't have any faith in your will or ability to resolve this based in the messages above.\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:13:11):Please action my previous message and ask a manager to call me asap on 07730 611327?\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:13:17):Thank you.\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:14:26):N.B. Most app based messaging services link through to account numbers so I don't appreciate being typed at like you have.\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:14:42):Terrible service\nFreddie(18:16:53):I'm sorry you feel that way. Sorry I did read your reply, I was just speaking to my manager\nFreddie(18:18:04):Okay so he has advised that we can raise an invoice dispute for you about the Dyno rod money that was taken from you the 2nd time. But I will need to confirm your full name to process that through, its just a piece of Data Protection I would need to go through with you  \nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:18:34):The invoice is from British Gas!! You have emailed me this afternoon.\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:18:40):Thomas Andrew Green\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:19:03):I am not paying it, if like it to be withdrawn\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:19:13):By British Gas\nFreddie(18:19:23):Thank you Thomas, no I know that. And as it comes from the Dyno Rod team I would have to raise a task to invoice the dispute. And yes that is correct\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:19:38):Who I am a customer of (nothing to do with Dyno - that's BG's relationship)\nFreddie(18:19:58):I appreciate that, I understand where you are coming from\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:20:00):It's all BG to me, don't care what team.\nFreddie(18:20:17):Of course, and that is the way it should be. I am sorry it is rather muddled with your excess\nFreddie(18:20:38):So the reason I wanted to check with Dyno is because if it was the exact same job, then thats absolutely fine\nFreddie(18:21:03):we can get that sorted out for you. It is just to double check that the engineer has gone out to the same job again, therefore you do not pay the excess\nFreddie(18:21:34):Am I okay to call them now? I would be a few minutes checking it for you and advising them of the situation\nFreddie(18:21:41):I feel that would be the quicker approach to resolve it\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:21:55):No problem\nFreddie(18:22:06):Thank you Thomas\nFreddie(18:22:10):Bear with me please\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:22:18):Ok\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:22:30):Can I close down the app for a couple of mins?\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:22:38):Or will I lose this?\nFreddie(18:22:55):I would keep the app open for a few more minutes if thats okay\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:22:59):Ok\nFreddie(18:23:04):Thank you!\nFreddie(18:29:08):Just on the phone to them now for you Thomas\nFreddie(18:29:15):Shes just explaining the jobs\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:29:38):Ok. The same engineer visited both times if that helps.\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:30:01):He accepted that the problem had not been resolved correctly in the first visit\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:30:26):I think it was bigger than he originally anticipated \nFreddie(18:33:46):Okay right I see\nFreddie(18:33:50):so thank you for holding\nFreddie(18:33:55):I've just got off the phone\nFreddie(18:34:03):So at the moment the advisor says she can see what happened\nFreddie(18:34:45):On the 2nd of August you had work carried out, and there was a follow up visit on the 3rd. the 2nd visit related to the 1st therefore there shouldnt have been charge. So I believe we are all in agreement that you should not need to pay the invoice you have been given\nFreddie(18:34:56):So she has also advised me on how to proceed with this\nFreddie(18:36:06):I can raise an invoice dispute on my end for you which I am happy to do. She has also given me a telephone number for yourself as well. The number is for the Dyno Rod local office who carried out your work. She advised to call this in the morning tomorrow and they should be able to confirm this for you. But I should be able to get the ball rolling by raising this dispute for you\nFreddie(18:36:09):Which I will do now\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:36:47):Ok, thank you. Can BG not just resolve it as I'm in work all day tomorrow.\nFreddie(18:37:42):Sure no problem at all. What I can do is chase this up for you myself tomorrow. I can save your details and try to get through to them for you. The invoice task I am raising for you will work anyway as they will just make sure everythings in check before they void the letter you received :)\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:38:12):Ok, thanks Freddie (you turned it around :))\nFreddie(18:38:40):Hahaha, I apologise if there was a confusion at the beginning. I didnt mean to come across rude or anything. I am a nice person I promise!\nFreddie(18:39:01):Please bear with me a little longer as I raise this invoice task for you\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:39:08):I'm sure you are, I am too, even if I have high service expectations!\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:39:22):Ok, no problem\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:39:37):Appreciate your assistance in getting this resolved\nFreddie(18:39:50):haha, I dont blame you! Thank you :) I'll be 2 mins\nFreddie(18:43:09):That is now all done for you - I will call the local office tomorrow to make sure they are aware of it Thomas. You should be contacted by BG once the resolution has been finalised. :)\nVisitor--950439521-9923(18:43:29):Perfect, thank you, and have a nice evening :)\nFreddie(18:43:46):You too Thomas. Take care and have a good evening :)\nFreddie(18:43:49):Bye!\n",

So I've got my appointment calendar up in front of me and there is reasonable availability from the 23rd of August on wards excluding the weekends.  Is there a date that suits you best? \nVisitor--950439520-7335(14:16:02):23rd fine \nAlex(14:17:17):Great, so there are two time slots free on that day. They are 8AM-12PM and then 1PM-5PM. Which of those would be best for you? \nVisitor--950439520-7335(14:17:32):8 -12 please \nAlex(14:18:41):OK, that's all selected for you then. We are almost all done! Finally we just need to go through a few additional questions to help our engineer out on the day.<br />\n<br />\nFirstly, your Smart Meters are free of charge and fitting them will take up to 2 hours and your supply will be switched off for some time. Is there mains powered medical equipment in your home or anyone who would be affected by having the gas or electricity switched off? \nVisitor--950439520-7335(14:19:20):No all.OK \nAlex(14:19:38):Great and during your appointment our engineer will offer you some energy efficiency advice. If you like, they can also tell you about relevant products that could help to reduce your energy consumption. They'll only tell you about British Gas products but other companies may also provide them. If they think there are some products that would be of benefit to you, would you like to hear about them?\nVisitor--950439520-7335(14:20:18):No don't think so \nAlex(14:20:32):OK, not to worry then. Once your Smart Meters have been fitted you can go online to view a regular report that shows you when and how you use your energy. To show your usage within each day we'll need to set your meters to collect the reading every 30 minutes, is that OK?  \nVisitor--950439520-7335(14:21:03):Yes that fine \nAlex(14:21:35):Great, so finally the engineer will try to call you before visiting your home. What is the best contact number for you? If you have a mobile number, that would be ideal. <br />\n\t<br />\nAlso you'll receive an email confirmation of your appointment as well as further emails letting you know what will happen on the day. What is the best email address to use?\nVisitor--950439520-7335(14:22:08):Number is  07562595074\nAlex(14:24:47):Great and what would be the best email address to reach you on?\nVisitor--950439520-7335(14:24:54):Msimester@outlook.com \nAlex(14:25:31):Thanks very much for that.

I moved house last year, my gas/electric and repair acounts have the correct address but when I go into my account details it still shows my old address, can this be changed?\nMohan(08:44:42):That is quite strange.

Thank you\nElliot(09:13:18):Thank you\nElliot(09:15:10):I see you have our boiler and central heating cover as well as home electric cover. There are a few\nreasons that contribute to the price of your quotation being higher than the\nprices that you see online. The agreements that you see online include a £60\nexcess which is payable for each completed repair. Also, the prices that we\nadvertise online are the acquisition prices for the 1st year only as an\nintroduction to the company. New customers receive this price because we have no\ninformation to base their price on regardless of the size of the property or\nthe age of the appliance etc.<br />\nVisitor--950439521-5769(09:16:41):ok that explains things a little for me, thank you.

It will take few minutes. \nVisitor--950439522-5681(08:56:48):Ok, no problem\nShailendra(08:58:19):Thanks for waiting, Zach.\nShailendra(08:58:43):I've just checked your gas and electricity bills dated 03 Aug 2016 and found that they're billed to your meter reads.\nVisitor--950439522-5681(08:59:42):Yes, my issue is with the period before the 17th June when my new meter was installed\nVisitor--950439522-5681(09:00:02):Meter number: S09G70128\nShailendra(09:01:28):Please give me a moment whilst I have deep look into it.\nVisitor--950439522-5681(09:02:09):Ok\nShailendra(09:03:23):Thanks for your patience. \nShailendra(09:05:17):Yes, the latest electricity bill is for the period from 27 Feb 2016 to 03 Aug 2016. If you see on the third page of your bill, we've provided you the bifurcation.\nVisitor--950439522-5681(09:05:47):I don't think you're understanding my issue\nVisitor--950439522-5681(09:06:30):From Feb 27th to June 16th I was on a pay as you go meter. On June 17th I was upgraded to credit meters.\nVisitor--950439522-5681(09:07:33):I am being re-billed/not charged correctly on the prepayment meter as this was always in credit and topped up when it got close to 0. So in theory, the payments made should equal what was charged, correct?\nVisitor--950439522-5681(09:08:48):I believe this bill should only be for the credit meter installed and activated 17th June 2016 and the figures from the previous meter are irrelevant.\nShailendra(09:09:32):Okay, I got it. Let me connect you to our Prepayment team and they'll correct this for you.

I just had a word from our prepayment and they have advised that the bill is incorrrect and we'll re-bill and send you the correct bill shortly. Please be rest assured, I've now arranged this to be corrected and we'll rectify it soon. Once this is done, you'll receive an email notificaiton about your new bill.\nVisitor--950439522-5681(09:14:34):Excellent, thank you very much\nShailendra(09:14:46):You're welcome.\nShailendra(09:14:58):Can I help you anymore as of now?\nVisitor--950439522-5681(09:15:53):Nope, it was just this. Thank you very much\nShailendra(09:16:13):One moment, Zach. Could you please help me with the current meter read if possible?\nVisitor--950439522-5681(09:17:25):It was 11500 for electric on the 3rd August, I'm at work so cannot provide one for today\nVisitor--950439522-5681(09:17:51):If you can bill to this period, I shall get it paid once sorted and set up onto direct debit\nShailendra(09:18:19):Not a problem. that's fine. I'll update it till 03rd Aug 2016 then.\nVisitor--950439522-5681(09:18:26):Thank you\nShailendra(09:18:36):You're welcome.\n"

I'm not going to make you give all your details again.  I'm just going to look at the chat you had with John to see how far he got with you. Are you ok to give me a minute?\nVisitor--950439519-6146(10:41:33):Yes\nAndy(10:42:22):Thanks - won't be long getting back to you...\nAndy(10:47:09):Hi. I'm looking at the credit you're putting into the electricity meter.  In June you put in £30.00 for the whole month - that's £1.00 per day.  Your meter has a standing charge of 26p per day. So your electricity cost for June was 74p per day.  \nVisitor--950439519-6146(10:48:12):I get my benefits every 2 week so I put 15 on as that all I can afford \nAndy(10:51:28):ok. I understand. The best thing for you to do is to speak with our Energy Efficiency team. they'll be able to give you a break down of what's using your electricity and give you tips on how to make your electricity go further. If you give them a call on <b>0800 072 8629 - </b>\nthey'll be able to help you with this. The good thing is here's nothing wrong with the meter - you're just needing help with how to make your moneu go further.\nVisitor--950439519-6146(10:51:52):Ok thanks \nAndy(10:52:42):I'll leave a clear note on your account just now Emma. We're here til 8.00pm if you need to come back to us at anytime on webchat.  Is there anything else i can advise on just now for you?\nVisitor--950439519-6146(10:52:58):No thanks \nINFO(10:53:01):Visitor has minimized chat\nAndy(10:53:26):Thanks Emma. When you press ‘end chat’ you'll be taken to a feedback\nsurvey about the way I’ve handled your enquiry today, if you can take a moment\nto complete this for me it would be appreciated.  Enjoy the rest of your day and thanks for using\nWebchat.\n"

How can I help you today?\nVisitor--950439519-6183(10:47:19):I have just had an engineer out to complete a first service. I have signed up to the home care 3. My boiler has not passed the service so now I am unsure of what to do. I was told I that I should look into getting a new boiler but this seems a bit extreme considering I don't know what is wrong with it? I was also told about a fix and service which I could look into?  Steph \nHayley(10:47:48):Hi Steph. Let me check what the engineer has put on the notes for you.\nHayley(10:47:52):Please could I take the first line of your address with your\npostcode and full name?\nVisitor--950439519-6183(10:48:08):19 elstree gardens\nVisitor--950439519-6183(10:48:14):Ne24 3rw\nVisitor--950439519-6183(10:48:19):Stephanie greenaway\nHayley(10:51:52):You  have two options we can do for you\nHayley(10:52:04):The first option is a one off repair. It includes parts, labour\nand the price is dependent on the time it takes to complete the repair.\n\n<br />\n \n\n<br />\n0-30 minutes is £79\n\n<br />\n31-120 minutes is £199\n\n<br />\nAbove 121 minutes will cost £409. \nHayley(10:52:13):The\nsecond option is called the Repair and Cover. We will fix the initial fault for\n£99 including parts and labour and then its £22 per month to look after your\ncentral heating system for future repairs. This would be a 12 month agreement\nand would include an annual service. \nVisitor--950439519-6183(10:55:23):Ok, so the plan I have just bought is now invalid? As that was on offer for £14 a month I think? It had 10% off and then an extra 10% for being a BG customer. \nVisitor--950439519-6183(10:56:51):What I find hard to understand is that I haven't been told what is wrong with the boiler and if it is safe. \nHayley(10:57:10):Yes that's correct. So we would change the policy to the £22 per month policy. The energy customer discount would be included.\nVisitor--950439519-6183(10:59:08):I see, do you know what would happen if the boiler cannot be fixed?  Would I still be fixed into the contract? \nHayley(10:59:32):No, we would cancel the policy and refund the £99 if we couldn't fix it.\nVisitor--950439519-6183(11:01:24):Ok, would I be able to do that please? How would I go about making an appointment? If it can be fixed I would prefer to do that than fork out for a new boiler at this point in time.\nHayley(11:01:47):Of course. I'll get my colleague to give you a quick call and get that changed and make the appointment. What is your best contact number please?\nVisitor--950439519-6183(11:02:55):Just my mobile on 07583409001\nHayley(11:03:14):Perfect. My colleague Bijal will call you back shortly\nVisitor--950439519-6183(11:03:48):Perfect thank you for yor help today Hayley much appreciated \nHayley(11:04:11):No problem at all. I would really appreciate your help by completing the\nquestions after the chat!

I have dual accounts with Brit Gas but through Sainsburys Energy. I usually make my readings through them online.

Advice please.\nLuke(11:52:35):Ok we can check both British Gas and Sainsburys for you, I will just need to look at your account a moment \nLuke(11:52:37):To help me find your account and for security, what’s your full name, house number, post code and date of birth please?\nVisitor--950439521-6448(11:53:15):Julian Paul Graff. 16. TN37 v6SE 4.8.1950\nVisitor--950439521-6448(11:53:30):Sorry: postcode is TN37 6SE\nLuke(11:53:48):thanks one moment while I load your details\nLuke(11:56:34):so you are showing as Sainsburys both online and on our systems with no connection to British Gas, I am just looking to see whether they have sent the wrong automated email by mistake\nLuke(11:56:45):you are also due a bill now\nVisitor--950439521-6448(11:58:39):ok thanks for your help. Thought sainsbiury's supplied me via Brit Gas.\nLuke(12:00:13):we do work in partnership with the same systems etc but we will separate everything for ease  \nLuke(12:00:44):I have also just double checked for you and this is a known issue your experiencing that we are trying to resolve and should be shorted shortly\nVisitor--950439521-6448(12:00:48):OK: guess I should ignore Btigas email and wait for Sainsbury's to contact me as they usually do?\nLuke(12:01:06):My advice would be to submit them directly on the sainsburys site\nLuke(12:01:30):the next contact will be by sainsburys from this point\nVisitor--950439521-6448(12:01:48):Thank you for your help Luke. I'll do that. Goodday and good bye\nLuke(12:02:09):Thank\nyou, have a nice day if you have no other questions I can help you with today?\nIf I could be so cheeky as to ask you to spare 20 seconds to leave me a\npositive feedback once you close the chat that would be appreciated. \n"

I'll just need two to three minutes to open up your account.\nImran(11:44:47):You previously had Central Heating Cover with us\nImran(11:44:53):and upgraded to the HomeCare Four\nImran(11:45:27):You wouldn't have the acquisition price that you may have seen advertised. Your current price is tailored to you.\nImran(11:45:54):It is based on a number of different factors such as where you live, the appliance make/model, the amount of times you have called us out and more.\nVisitor--950439521-6390(11:46:52):I have never received confirmation of a different prince. In fact I have never received confirmation of any price with the order.

Please check price\nImran(11:50:54):No problem\nImran(11:51:08):Would you\nconsider adding an excess on to your agreement? This could reduce the monthly\npremiums.\nVisitor--950439521-6390(11:51:26):No excess please\nImran(11:51:43):I’ll see what I can do about the price if we keep your\nlevel of cover as it is. I’ll just be 3-6 minutes.\nImran(11:59:28):I really appreciate your patience\nImran(11:59:31):Just waiting for the system\nImran(12:01:36):I can get the price down from £36.20 to £33.49\nVisitor--950439521-6390(12:02:07):Thank you. We will take that.\nImran(12:02:23):Fantastic, I'll just need to confirm a few things with you.\nImran(12:05:04):To confirm, your new annual price is £385.93. Your next direct\ndebit will be £33.49 on 15.09.2016 and then £33.43 each month after. Your outstanding\nbalance is £200.64. These prices include the discount I have applied, as well as Insurance\nPremium Tax. This price will run up until your next renewal date on 21.02.2017.\nImran(12:05:19):Are you happy to go ahead with\nthis or are there any further changes you’d like to make?\nVisitor--950439521-6390(12:05:46):Happy with that. Thank you\nImran(12:06:20):Just lastly - You\nwill receive confirmation including full terms and conditions via post/email in\nthe next 7-10 working days including the price and your payment schedule. These\ndocuments are important so please have a read of the paperwork once received to\nmake sure everything is okay.\nImran(12:06:31):That’s all done\nfor you now, is there anything else I can help you with today?\nVisitor--950439521-6390(12:06:36):Thank you for your help\nImran(12:06:51):You're welcome, thank you for your patience.\nImran(12:06:57):and thank you for using the web chat service.

It depends of regional availability, I'm afraid I can't confirm availability in your area at this moment in time, however if you go to the smart meter section of the website, you would be asked to book an appointment to upgrade and this will show you the appointments we have available for you. \nVisitor--950439522-6704(12:45:08):If I am switching from another supplier I assume I just give details to you and you arrange the switch wth the current supplier?

Then just before you come onto supply we will contact you for opening meter readings. \nRhydian(12:45:52):These readings are then forwarded on to your current supplier, who will then provide you with your final bill. The whole process usually takes around 2 and a half weeks. Don't worry all the hard work is done by us.\nVisitor--950439522-6704(12:47:41):Ok sounds great. 2 and a half weeks would be fine.\nVisitor--950439522-6704(12:47:51):Thansk for your help that is all I need right now\nRhydian(12:48:04):You're welcome. \nRhydian(12:48:10):Have a great day. \n"

Please bear with me while I get you back onto quarterly bills again.\nAndrew(12:58:49):Thanks for waiting for me Rachel. We created two bills in two months because we received a meter reading one month from yourself and then the next month a meter reader came out and provided us with your readings. Both these things created a bill for you each time. Please be assured this won't be the case in the following months.\nAndrew(13:01:45):Is that okay Rachel?\nVisitor--950439523-6628(13:02:32):yes that is fine thank you\nAndrew(13:03:16):Thanks\nfor chatting with me today Rachel.  Please feel\nfree to exit the chat and complete the survey, which is a reflection of my\nservice today and not the business.

Sorry about that. \nVisitor--950439497-7047(13:39:14):Thanks I do think that it would be good for the gas board to provide this kind of information for customers as we wouldn't like them to faint with the shock of prices.\nKatia(13:40:43):We do provide an online calculator for an estimated cost, however this includes the cost of the boiler itself. We just don't have a calculator which excludes the boiler cost, sorry about that. \nVisitor--950439497-7047(13:41:58):thanks\nKatia(13:42:58):You're welcome.

If you like, they can also tell you about relevant products that could help to reduce your energy consumption. They'll only tell you about British Gas products but other companies may also provide them. If they think there are some products that would be of benefit to you, would you like to hear about them?\nVisitor--950439520-7147(13:57:52):yes\nRhydian(13:57:56):Once the Smart Meters have been fitted you can go online to view a regular report that shows you when and how you use your energy. To show your usage within each day we'll need to set your meters to collect the reading every 30 minutes, is that ok?  \nVisitor--950439520-7147(13:58:19):es\nRhydian(13:58:34):OK great, if you ever want to change this to daily or monthly just get in touch.\nRhydian(13:58:38):You'll receive an email confirmation of your appointment as well as further emails letting you know what will happen on the day.

You’re Chatting with Ndi...\n\n<br />\n How can\nI help...\nVisitor--950439521-6951(13:21:22):I am trying to purchase homecare online as I cancelled my renewal on th 4th aug as I could get a better price online, however I am now trying to purchase it online and it is saying I am already got homeserve?\nNdi(13:23:15):Hi there I'm sorry about that sounds like there may be a cooling period before it allows you to take out another one...are you ok to give me a moment to find out what's going on for you..I'll just need to call our Services Team and find out for you.......Could I also take your full name, full address inc post code and email address to get your account up at this side as well please...\nVisitor--950439521-6951(13:25:03):Matthew Hawkins,  9 Westfield, Basildon, Essex, SS156RJ email:juliney@yahoo.com\nNdi(13:25:31):Thank you, just a moment please I'll just call them and find out what's going on for you...\nNdi(13:26:55):Just whilst I'm checking things for you..is just the price that's different for you then  when you take it out online\nVisitor--950439521-6951(13:27:40):Thats correct it is a lot cheaper online with british gas\nNdi(13:30:44):Thanks for the wait there...I've just spoken to one of my colleagues in our Services Team and they've also confirmed my suspicions on the cooling of period. I've been advice that there is a cooling of period of 3 months once the Homecare cover has been cancelled..If you'd like to chat with them and get more information, I can get you through to one of my colleagues from that team..\nVisitor--950439521-6951(13:32:50):If you could please as I am not sure why there is a cool of period of 3 months?  I want to get cover now, so I have to wait for 3 months as when I spoke to them on the phone they could not match the online quote\nNdi(13:33:47):Sure, I'll get you through and they can give you more information and resolve this for you...\nFreddie(13:34:28):    Good afternoon, you’re through to Freddie at the HomeCare team in British Gas\nFreddie(13:34:47):Im just having a read of the above\nVisitor--950439521-6951(13:34:55):Hi,  ok\nFreddie(13:36:08):During the 3 month period it give the customer the opportunity to reinstate their contract if they do have a problem they are experiencing.\nVisitor--950439521-6951(13:36:41):So am I covered for the next three months then?\nFreddie(13:37:26):No, you are not paying for it. But if you did have fault within that time, we would back-date the payments so that you would be able to reinstate.\nVisitor--950439521-6951(13:38:46):THis is a joke, I want to have homecare, but I want to pay the price on your website, not the renewal letter price.  But I cannot buy it online because of a cool off period???\nFreddie(13:40:17):A cool off period is there to deter customers from cancelling contracts and re setting up unnecessarily.\nVisitor--950439521-6951(13:42:52):Its not unnecessarily, I can get HOMECARE 4 FOR £17.50 online where you are currently charging me £24.39 for homecare 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Definately not unnecessarily Freddie, its the same company with all the same details yet the massive price difference???? I can get homecare 2 for £12.10 online thus half price per month!!!!!\nFreddie(13:44:09):So I appreciate where you are coming from - I would feel the same way as you in your position. But we do have a team who deal with this exact issue. Did you speak to our customer care team? <br />\n<br />\nI can explain why the prices to change and why they are different to online prices. Do keep in mind\nthat the prices we advertise are the acquisition prices for the 1st year only\nas an introduction to the company. New customers receive this price because we\nhave no information to base their price on regardless of the size of the\nproperty or the age of the appliance etc.\n\n<br />\nFrom the 2nd year\nof your agreement, pricing is based individually on factors such as make,\nmodel, and age of the boiler, the size of the property and also your boiler and\nbreakdown history for the past two years and previous discount history. When\nyou first joined British Gas you will have also received the acquisition price\nat that time so as much as I understand the advertisements do show cheaper\nprices - every customer is treated fairly.\nFreddie(13:44:51):But with your contract as it is, you can still speak to our customer care team if you were unhappy about your price and you do still want homecare, there are options that we can go through with yourself\nVisitor--950439521-6951(13:46:33):So what you are saying is loyal customers have to pay double so that new customers can, I will then just have to renew with someone else as I cannot do this with british gas due to the cool off period, wasnt considering it however are now left with no other choise as I do not want to be without cover.\nFreddie(13:47:34):Well I have offered you an alternative way of going about this, obviously we don't want to lose your custom. I am happy to pass you over to our customer care team who can take a look at this for you? As I said earlier there are other options. \nVisitor--950439521-6951(13:48:22):Also the make and model of boiler etc etc was typed in and provided on the quote so that cant count and I have allways paid £21 odd or more for this cover hence why I am so appauled\nVisitor--950439521-6951(13:48:54):Can you pass me over to the customer care team please\nFreddie(13:48:58):So it is to do with the size of your central heating and how easily maintainable it is, so yes it is taken into consideration.\nFreddie(13:49:14):Okay sure - Bear with me please\nVisitor--950439521-6951(13:52:28):Afternoon Gemma, can you please confirm if you can match the quoted price online for homecare 4 at £17.50pm\nGemma(13:53:30):Hi I'm Gemma I will bring up the account details for you to check what discount we can offer, we can reactivate the old agreement and offer a discount on this for you.\nVisitor--950439521-6951(13:54:22):Thank you\nGemma(13:57:51):Thanks for your patience with the cover you are currently on we could look to bring the price down to around £17 per month this is the HomeCare 200 with no excess per repair. If you would like to arrange this I can ask one of our HomeCare team to call you back?\nVisitor--950439521-6951(13:59:50):I can get Homecare2 online for £12.10 with british gas which is what I was on before however I can also get homecare4 online for £17.50\nGemma(14:00:20):The price you are looking at is with a £60 excess per repair, I have quoted you for no excess.\nGemma(14:00:31):You can reduce the monthly price by adding an excess to the agreement.\nVisitor--950439521-6951(14:02:51):From memory when I input my boiler details and property details there was no excess?  I will go and double check this and get back to british gas thanks\nGemma(14:03:29):Thats no problem would you like me to wait on chat whilst you check this?\nVisitor--950439521-6951(14:04:51):No that is not necessary I have to get back to work now as my lunch break is over I will look into this at a later stage seing as there is a 3 month cool off period\n",

You can do this via your online account, would you like me to run you through how to do so? Please bear in mind that if you have had your meters installed today, this information will still be updating on our system so you would not benefit from the free period until this had been completed.\nVisitor--950439520-8078(15:25:54):i have not got a computer we are using the library\nAlex(15:26:55):OK, in that case you can contact customer services on 0800 048 0202 and they will be happy to help you further with getting your tariff switched over John. Just to clarify but you are currently speaking to the Smart Meter installation team so I'm afraid I'm not able to switch your tariff over directly myself. \nVisitor--950439520-8078(15:28:13):ok i will ring today thank you for your time\nAlex(15:28:26):That's my pleasure, can I help with anything else at all today? \nVisitor--950439520-8078(15:28:56):no thank you\nAlex(15:29:01):Great, well thanks for chatting with me today.

How can I help today? \nVisitor--950439523-8418(15:52:31):Would like a smart meter \nAlex(15:52:59):Great, OK in order to get an appointment booked in for you today I'll need to take your full name and the full address of the property please Carol. \nVisitor--950439523-8418(15:54:18):Carol Hall   2d Greenside Way Yew Tree Walsall WS5 4BS\nAlex(15:55:50):Thanks very much for that Carol, OK before we can book the appointment I'll need to go through a few eligibility questions in order to make sure we can install our meters there. <br />\n<br />\nFirstly, are all the meters and the fuse box accessible? \nVisitor--950439523-8418(15:56:21):Yes they are\nAlex(15:56:56):OK, and what type of property is it Carol? \nVisitor--950439523-8418(15:57:13):It's a house\nAlex(15:57:42):Great and lastly is there any micro-generation equipment there such as solar panels? \nVisitor--950439523-8418(15:58:23): No there isn't \nAlex(15:59:52):OK, so I have my appointment calendar up now and the soonest I can book you in for is Wednesday 17th of August between 9AM-1PM. How would that work for you Carol? \nVisitor--950439523-8418(16:00:38):That's fine thank you\nAlex(16:01:23):Perfect, so lastly we just need to go through some information that will help out engineer out on the day.<br />\n<br />\nFirst of all, your Smart Meters are free of charge and fitting them will take up to 2 hours and your supply will be switched off for some time. Is there mains powered medical equipment in your home or anyone who would be affected by having the gas or electricity switched off? \nVisitor--950439523-8418(16:02:06):No that will be ok\nAlex(16:02:51):OK and during your appointment our engineer will offer you some energy efficiency advice. If you like, they can also tell you about relevant products that could help to reduce your energy consumption. They'll only tell you about British Gas products but other companies may also provide them. If they think there are some products that would be of benefit to you, would you like to hear about them?\nVisitor--950439523-8418(16:03:48):Not at this time thank you\nAlex(16:04:25):OK, not to worry then, once your Smart Meters have been fitted you can go online to view a regular report that shows you when and how you use your energy. To show your usage within each day we'll need to set your meters to collect the reading every 30 minutes, is that OK?  \nVisitor--950439523-8418(16:05:00):That's fine\nAlex(16:05:41):Great, so the engineer will try to call you before visiting your home. What is the best contact number for you? If you have a mobile number, that would be great. <br />\n\t<br />\nAlso you'll receive an email confirmation of your appointment as well as further emails letting you know what will happen on the day. What is the best email address to use?\nVisitor--950439523-8418(16:06:52):Carh668@aol.com\nAlex(16:07:36):Thanks very much for that, what would be the best number to contact you on Carol? \nVisitor--950439523-8418(16:08:02):07909199753\nAlex(16:10:31):Thanks very much for\nthat. We are all done then!<br />\n<br />\nJust to confirm that the smart meters are free of charge and your tariff\nwill stay the same and just to remind you, your supply will be switched off for\ntwo hours for the appointment and the engineer can arrive at any point during\nthe time slot.  That’s all booked in for Wednesday  17th  of August between 9AM and 1PM. Is that all\nOK?\nVisitor--950439523-8418(16:11:28):Thank you \nAlex(16:12:15):That's my pleasure, can I help you with anything else at all today? \nAlex(16:17:33):I haven’t heard back from you so this chat is closing now.

After receiving a letter from British Gas (CAM/HMV/MVE1) in the wake of my move in an apartment, I went online to create my account. It appears that it is necessary to create an account by email/chat/call before being able to register online.      It would be easier for a customer like to me to create and register an online account at once.    '10' for the Customer Service Advisor because the exchange was friendly (introduced himself at the beginning of the exchange, told me good bye, was polite) and seemed efficient in the handling of information.     I am now waiting for receiving the email informing me that my account has been created.\n\nQ: Q01_Post_chat_nps_survey\nA: NPS 6\n\nQ: Q05_Enquiry_Resolved\nA: Resolved\n\n"

First of all could I please take your full name and the full address of the property? \nVisitor--950439521-8711(16:21:18):Shahnaz Arshad. 57 jermyn drive Ng5 9pn. \nAlex(16:21:55):Thanks very much for that Shahnaz,  please bear with me a moment whilst I bring up your account. \nAlex(16:23:24):OK, so I've had a look at the account Shahnaz and it appears that you have a multi phase meter (Economy 7/10), which means you get cheaper off peak overnight electricity. Unfortunately our smart meter technology can't support this type of meter yet. Our technology is developing all the time though to make sure we hit the Government’s target to have all homes in the UK fitted with smart meters by 2020.\nAlex(16:23:46):What I can do for you today is register your interest in Smart Meters, which means as soon as we are able to do so, we will contact you to upgrade your meters. Is that OK? \nVisitor--950439521-8711(16:24:33):Ok thanks.  But would it be possible to change the meter\nAlex(16:25:14):In order to do that you would need to contact customer services on 0800 048 0202 and they will be happy to go through the process with you today. \nVisitor--950439521-8711(16:25:30):Ok thanks\nAlex(16:25:56):That's my pleasure, can I help with anything else today at all? \nAlex(16:29:31):I haven’t heard back from you so this chat is closing now.

Our current smart meter technology is only suitable for homes where the gas is supplied by the major gas transporters in the UK. Unfortunately your gas is not being supplied by one of these, and, because of this we are not currently able to install smart meters in your home.\nAlex(12:25:07):I am sorry that no one was in touch to tell you this, however I am trying to find the point of contact you had to clarify why this wasn't followed up on and if it was when it was we tried to contact you but there doesn't seem to be a record of it on your account. Did you call in when you last spoke to someone about Smart Meters?\nAlex(12:27:08):Aha, I've found it listed on the account. \nVisitor--950439497-6544(12:27:24):OK now I know I will stop waiting. And yes it was me who called you in the first place \nAlex(12:28:12):OK, so I've had a look on the notes left and I believe that you should have received an email from ourselves with the same information I've just given you. Did you ever get that email Tracey?\nVisitor--950439497-6544(12:30:13):No I never and I thought with having both fuels with you it would have been easier for you to do\nAlex(12:32:11):Normally that would be the case but unfortunately as the property is supplied by an independent transporter (that's the company that takes our gas into your home) we aren't actually able to upgrade the gas meter there I'm afraid. \nAlex(12:32:54):I am sorry that you weren't contacted but it's possible that the email may have ended up in your junk or spam folder, and that it may have since been deleted automatically. Apologies again that you've had to take time out to chase this up. \nVisitor--950439497-6544(12:35:01):OK thankyou it may as you say ended up in the junk file. At least I know now Thanks again. Tracey\nAlex(12:35:37):Well that's my pleasure and I'm glad I got that clarified for that you. Can I help with anything else today? \n"

The majority I have had relate to the fact that my Hive was incorrectly installed.  Almost 50% more does seems high even though I know that existing customers are generally penalised\nHayley(16:23:10): We\nhaven't currently got anyone available on webchat to see if they can do anything on the renewal price for you, you can\neither contact them later or you can call our customer care team on 0800 048\n1000. I can also arrange a call back for you within 48 working hours if you\nprefer? \nVisitor--950439521-8697(16:24:13):I am currently on holiday.  I will call next week to discuss.  Thanks.

Would you like me to run you through how to do so?\nVisitor--950439521-5992(10:06:12):We have an on line account so we can do it this way.

All insurance products would charge insurance premium tax.\nVisitor--950439522-6440(11:50:09):essentially I don't understand why my agreement has increased by almost £45 for the year. that over 10% up on last year\nMohan(11:50:55):At the renewal stage of the policy, factors\nlike the size of the central heating system, breakdown history and where you\nlive (hard/soft water, ease to reach location). Also considered are things like the age of the boiler, number of radiators and size of the property.\nMohan(11:51:09):These factor do have an effect on the price at renewal.\nVisitor--950439522-6440(11:51:10):How does British Gas arrive at these kind of figures.\nVisitor--950439522-6440(11:52:41):Well my house and its condition has not changed in the 10 years I have lived here. You are offering my policy for £12.20 a month with  £60 excess, probably for new customers, but what aboyt the loyal ones that have been with you for over 30 years?\nMohan(11:54:00):The boiler age is a factor that is considered during renewal, as older boilers would cost more to look after. I am able to look at the renewal for you to see if a reduction can be offered.\nVisitor--950439522-6440(11:56:00):Please have a look and see what you can do, otherwise I may need to consider my options with another supplier.\nVisitor--950439522-6440(11:56:33):I don't really want to consider any kind of excesss policy to get the price down.\nMohan(11:56:58):OK, so can you confirm your address and postcode please?\nVisitor--950439522-6440(11:57:59):2 Charity View, Knowle, Fareham, PO17 5NG.\n#\nMohan(11:58:39):Thanks, can you also confirm your name please?\nVisitor--950439522-6440(11:58:46):Brian Edwards\nVisitor--950439522-6440(12:00:03):Is it also possible to change the account name so that it is both mine and my wifes name (Lynda Edwards) for the main gas account and the Home care account please.\nMohan(12:01:17):Thanks Brian. I cannot change the name on the gas account as I am a Homecare advisor, but I can on this agreement. You mentioned you don't want to include an excess in the policy, would you consider removing part of your agreement to\nbring down the cost?\nVisitor--950439522-6440(12:02:30):I still want the same cover as I have now.\nVisitor--950439522-6440(12:03:09):Do I need to speak to another advisor to get the gas account naming changed.\nMohan(12:04:21):Yes, you would need to contact our energy team on 0800 048 0202 to add your wife's name to the energy account.\nMohan(12:04:40):I am just checking to see what can be offered for your Homecare agreement. I will be 2-3 minutes.\nMohan(12:06:55):I am sorry for the delay here Brian, my system has just decided to crash and nothing is opening up again. \nMohan(12:10:32):I am sorry about this Brian, but I cannot get back into the system to reduce the price. I don't want to waste your time keeping you chat while I sort this out. In this case, we can still get the price reduced for you, but you would need to contact our customer care team on 0800 294 9650. Alternatively, you can come back onto webchat to speak with a different advisor who will be able to reduce the cost for you.\nMohan(12:10:49):They will also be able to see our previous chat as well. I do apologise about this.\n"

This is a 12 month agreement.\nVisitor--950439521-6587(12:25:45):I want to go for the first option- the thing is, someone from Baxi last October left a list of things that needed to be checked/fixed and I am not sure they have been, so I would like someone to come over and confirm if it has been done and if not do it-\nElliot(12:27:05):Okay I understand. These options are priced to repair one fault, so if there are more we would provide you with a quote to repair anything else that might be wrong\nElliot(12:27:18):With option 1, you would pay £89 for the attendance \nVisitor--950439521-6587(12:29:24):that would be fine\nVisitor--950439521-6587(12:29:33):Can it be done today?\nElliot(12:29:46):Okay certainly, our services team can book this in for you, and you can reach them 24/7 on 0800 048 1000\nElliot(12:29:53):My colleagues will be happy to help you with this :)\nVisitor--950439521-6587(12:31:03):Great, I'll just ring them then\nVisitor--950439521-6587(12:31:15):Thank you\nElliot(12:31:16):Great!

I'll just locate your details, I'll be as quick as i can.\nPaul(11:04:53):Sorry to keep you there Jordan. Thanks for your patience there, I've got your details now. How can I help you today?\nVisitor--950439523-6245(11:07:18):I moved into this property on the 21st and set up an account with you guys, but I've still not had a letter to confirm anything and I get charged within the next week. Also I when rang up to make an account it charged me £30 on my phone bill \nPaul(11:09:11):I'm sorry to hear of the problems you've had Jordan. I'll certainly help you with this as much as I can. If you could bear with me a few moments, I'm just going to check your account and see what's happened so far.\nPaul(11:13:56):Thanks again for waiting there Jordan. Looking at the account, no documentation appears to have been sent out. I'm not sure why this has happened, I'm just speaking with our Homemov team about this for you now. \nVisitor--950439523-6245(11:14:28):Okay\nPaul(11:19:21):My colleague has advised, they can't see why the welcome pack hasn't been sent out. he is aware of a system issue that has stopped some being sent out initially. Although the scenario of that is a little bit different to how you contacted us to set up your account. He's just speaking sending a request to get your welcome pack sent to you. I'll just be a few more moments.\nPaul(11:22:20):Ok, sorry to keep you there. My colleague has sent the request off for you now. Your welcome pack will be sent out within the next 14 days. He's also left clear notes on your account for what he's done. So should there be any issues, we have a record of it.\nPaul(11:23:28):You mentioned when you called to set up your account, you ended up with charges of £30 for calling us. All our numbers are freephone ones. Could I just ask what the number was you used to call us?\nVisitor--950439523-6245(11:24:52):Also they said on my first bill they will cone out and check my meter because they are charging me £40 and I know I will not use that much gas but I don't want to ring up because of the charge.. I've got just quickly check my phone records will this conversation end if I click off the screen? \nINFO(11:25:03):Visitor has minimized chat\nINFO(11:25:06):Visitor has maximized chat\nINFO(11:25:15):Visitor has minimized chat\nPaul(11:26:05):I have your details Jordan. If I lose you for any reason, I'll call you to continue this with you.\nINFO(11:26:32):Visitor has maximized chat\nVisitor--950439523-6245(11:30:45):The number we had is 09135818927 and it charged 27.99 plus V.A.T and the call lasted 31 minutes and 7 seconds \nINFO(11:30:59):Visitor has minimized chat\nPaul(11:31:17):Ok, thanks for the information there Jordan. Where did you get the number from?\nINFO(11:32:16):Visitor has maximized chat\nINFO(11:32:53):Visitor has minimized chat\nINFO(11:36:20):Visitor has maximized chat\nINFO(11:36:27):Visitor has minimized chat\nINFO(11:39:00):Visitor has maximized chat\nVisitor--950439523-6245(11:40:30):could you possibly ring me later in the week because i've lost the phone bill and need to get a new one \nPaul(11:40:30):Hi Jordan, so i can establish where this number is coming from. Would you be able to let me know where you got it from? I've just looked on the British Gas website and it't not on there. \nVisitor--950439523-6245(11:41:32):could you possibly ring me later in the week because i've lost the phone bill and need to get a new one\nPaul(11:42:52):All I need to know is where you got the number from. For example was it from a service like 118118? As they will connect you, but they do charge for doing so at their rates.\nVisitor--950439523-6245(11:46:45):i'll be honest with you, I used my dad's phone to ring them and I have no idea how I got that number, my dad's just got to go into EE to get a copy of the phone bill \nPaul(11:48:15):Let me just try the number. See where it sends me to.\nVisitor--950439523-6245(11:48:40):ok \nPaul(11:55:21):I've just called the number and it disconnects straight away. This means the number isn't a valid number. If you called this number and were connected to us, it's possible it could be a fraudulent service. This would require your dad to contact his mobile provider.\nPaul(11:55:50):Regrattably it's not something we would be able to compensate you for.\nPaul(11:56:58):Could I also ask, you mentioned that we would be charging you £40 on your first bill. What did they advise that was for? \nVisitor--950439523-6245(11:59:47):I rang her up and made a new account and she asked me how much water and heating I use I told her I don't use heating at all and she said she will put me on a tariff for £40 which will be charged on the 14th.. Also about that number I spoke to British gas to make up an account so how else would you have all my details especially when I've never been with British gas before? \nVisitor--950439523-6245(12:00:50):I also gave my bank details to them so if it was a fraud line they would of took money out but nothing has been taken \nPaul(12:06:31):I'm not doubting you spoke with us Jordan. I can see you did call us. The number you've given me isn't a valid number. If your dad has been charged for calling that number, then he needs to question that with his mobile phone provider. I can't compensate you for that. Looking at your account, the £40 you're mentioning is to pay by monthly Direct Debit. As we have no usage history for you at the moment. We have to complete what's called a consumption calculator for you. This estimates what you will use based on what you tell us. I appreciate that you may not be using £40 a month at the moment. The Direct Debit is set for 12 months. So it stays the same in the colder months where you may be using more that that. The credit built up now is used to help keep things the same in the winter. if you feel £40 is too much, what do you feel would be a fairer amount?\nVisitor--950439523-6245(12:11:30):So if I only used £20 this month will the other £20 go into my credit and be used if I go over? and also I can pay £40 this month but could you get a rough idea how much gas I have used and then change over to how ever much I am using? \nPaul(12:14:23):Yes, if you only use £20 this month and pay £40. Then your account will be £20 in credit and this will rollover to your next bill. We assess the Direct Debit after 6 months to check how it's going and see whether it needs increasing or decreasing. I would recommend to wait until then before you make any changes. This will give us a fair reflection of what's being used.\nVisitor--950439523-6245(12:15:42):Yeah that's absolutely fine, I really appreciate your help. You've been an absolute star :) \nPaul(12:16:20):My pleasure Jordan. I'll raise this as a complaint for you. So we have a record of it for you. Could\nI just confirm that you’re happy for your complaint to be closed today? \nVisitor--950439523-6245(12:17:47):more than happy, great service.\nPaul(12:17:59):great, thanks Jordan. I can see we currently don't supply your Electricity. How do\nyou feel about transferring your electricity supply to BG?\nVisitor--950439523-6245(12:23:25):I will review at six months to see how I get along with the electric company I'm with now, if I'm not happy with it I would consider transferring to BG.  \nPaul(12:23:53):No problem Jordan. Thanks for your time enjoy the rest of your day.\nPaul(12:23:53):When the chat ends, you’ll be sent a survey to leave\nfeedback on how you felt I dealt with your enquiry on web chat today. \nIt's purely about me and the way I help you, I’d be grateful if you could fill\nthis in, I’d appreciate your comments about the way I’ve helped you today.\nPaul(12:23:55):Bye.\n"

Will it be available before 11am tomorrow morning?\nAshley(12:52:12):48 working hours = 6 working days so from yesterday when it was completed it could be next Wednesday it is uploaded until.\nVisitor--950439520-6664(12:54:27):This won't work and will cause immense issues for me and the tenant.  I need to speak to someone who can help expedite this please. There must be a route to  manage unusually urgent cases?\nAshley(12:56:01):As it's within the system this is the time it can take for the system to upload it. Only after the 48 working hours can we forward this on if you have not received it. \nAshley(12:56:14):We can't make the system work any faster. \nVisitor--950439520-6664(12:57:02):Couldn't someone produce a manual cert - to allow the move to make place?\nAshley(12:58:40):This is the quickest we can produce it. I would have already offered any quicker routes. You can call our landlords team on 0800 107 7798 and they will be able to clarify what it is I have discussed today and verify that there is no quicker way than this. \nVisitor--950439520-6664(12:59:38):thank you.\nAshley(12:59:56):Is there anything else I can help you with today? \nAshley(13:01:57):Thank you for your time today. \n"

This covers your boiler & controls, and central heating system. You can upgrade yes. You can take out Plumbing & Drains cover to add to your existing agreement. If you were to add this on, you would have to change your excess for your central heating to either £0 or £60 so both have the same excess. \nFaheem(13:51:39):I'm just getting the prices for you \nFaheem(13:53:18):If you were to have your Central Heating & your Plumbing & Drains with a £0 excess this would cost £34.05 a month <br />\n<br />\nIf you were to have your Central Heating & your Plumbing & Drains with a £60 excess this would cost £23.08 a month \nVisitor--950439497-7128(13:56:53):Thank you. If I opt for the £60 excess would I be eligible for a plumbing repair now as I have a leaking sink.

Also, has access been created for the boiler?\nVisitor--950439520-7732(14:56:23):yes, the issue was we had new kitchen cupboards, but its resolved now\nVisitor--950439520-7732(14:56:34):boiler is working fine\nMohan(14:57:13):Great and apart from the boiler, do you have any other gas appliances you would like serviced? \nVisitor--950439520-7732(14:59:06):We had a smart gas meter fitted a while back, and it's very noisy\nVisitor--950439520-7732(14:59:19):not sure if that needs to be looked at\nMohan(15:00:38):Is the actual meter that is noisy Ken? Or is it the monitor which is part of the meter that is noisy?\nVisitor--950439520-7732(15:00:50):the meter\nMohan(15:01:35):Can I ask what type of meter it is? Is it the gas meter?\nVisitor--950439520-7732(15:01:44):yes, the gas meter\nMohan(15:02:50):Ok, just for safety Ken, do you notice any smell of gas since the meter has become noisy?

To confirm the service is booked for Tuesday 30th August between 8am-10am.\nMohan(15:11:32):With regards to the noisy meter, I have just spoken to them and they have asked me to ask you, is the noise a buzzing noise or a bleeping noise? Also, is it very loud?\nVisitor--950439520-7732(15:12:15):sounds a bit like an alarm, so bleeping maybe\nMohan(15:12:59):I understand. In this case Ken, they have said that if you call the metering team on 0800 975 5555, they will take a few details and they can also check the meter from their end. If needs be, they can then book a meter exchange for you.\nVisitor--950439520-7732(15:13:05):its right outside the kitchen in the front of the house. you can't hear it in the house, just when you are outside\nVisitor--950439520-7732(15:13:20):ok, will do\nVisitor--950439520-7732(15:13:21):thanks\nMohan(15:13:59):You're welcome Ken.

		"chat-log": "Freddie(14:46:13):Good afternoon,\nyou’re through to Freddie at the HomeCare team in British Gas, how can I help\nyou today?\nVisitor--950439519-7691(14:46:25):i dont wish to continue my boiler service contract\nFreddie(14:46:43):Okay sure no worries - Is there any particular reason you are looking to cancel?\nVisitor--950439519-7691(14:47:06):price is ridiculous\nFreddie(14:48:19):If our customer care team could help with the price would you be interested in staying?\nVisitor--950439519-7691(14:48:30):you steal about one month every year too\nFreddie(14:49:12):Well I understand that your price has gone up, but it isn't stealing. I can go through why your price changes.\nVisitor--950439519-7691(14:49:39):it is if you charge for 12 month and every year move it\nFreddie(14:50:08):Sorry I don't know what you mean? what do we move, the price?\nVisitor--950439519-7691(14:51:07):my service used to be march now its end of july\nVisitor--950439519-7691(14:51:30):so you service every 13 month\nFreddie(14:52:01):So typically we want to do the service every year. But the service can be done where ever within the contractual year\nVisitor--950439519-7691(14:52:14):price is on your website is about half what im paying\nFreddie(14:52:15):So sometimes if there is no availability, you will end up maybe pushing it further a month\nVisitor--950439519-7691(14:53:11):yes but coveniently that happens evey year\nFreddie(14:53:52):Annual services do get busy around this time and around winter as you can imagine with the run up to Christmas - And that is a new customer pricing which currently comes with 10% off and shows agreements with a £60 excess - Do keep in mind\nthat the prices we advertise are the acquisition prices for the 1st year only\nas an introduction to the company. New customers receive this price because we\nhave no information to base their price on regardless of the size of the\nproperty or the age of the appliance etc.\n\n<br />\n \n\n<br />\nFrom the 2nd year\nof your agreement, pricing is based individually on factors such as make,\nmodel, and age of the boiler, the size of the property and also your boiler and\nbreakdown history for the past two years and previous discount history. When\nyou first joined British Gas you will have also received the acquisition price\nat that time so as much as I understand the advertisements do show cheaper\nprices - every customer is treated fairly.\nVisitor--950439519-7691(14:55:16):10% isnt half\nFreddie(14:56:14):Yes because you are an existing customer and the above explains why yours and other customers price changes after the 1st year\nVisitor--950439519-7691(14:57:40):so you want me to subsidise new cutomers\nFreddie(14:58:54):No thats not the case. If you have been happy with the level of service you have received from British Gas, then thats great. I know you may not feel the same about the price. We do have a customer care team that can look at your price for you and see what we can do. Would you like to contact them?\nVisitor--950439519-7691(14:59:24):yes\nFreddie(15:01:12):Sure their number is 0800 294 9123. This is a free phone number.\nFreddie(15:01:23):Is there anything else I can help with at all?\nVisitor--950439519-7691(15:04:46):no\nFreddie(15:05:12):Take care - I hope you get this resolved :)\nVisitor--950439519-7691(15:06:17):haha 54 minute wait hilarious\nFreddie(15:06:50):There is someone available online\nFreddie(15:06:51):bear with me\nImran(15:07:19):Good afternoon.

Hot water comes from a water heater but the water is only hot if the ground temperature is high.  As a result the water is not very hot in the winter.  What sort of heater would provide hot water all year round and what would be the cost of providing and installing this?  Thank you.  My gas appliances are covered by British Gas Home Care.   My mother, who shares the house, is a pensioner.\nFreddie(13:55:52):Sure, we can replace your fire with a combi boiler. I presume you have a back boiler fire? The combi boiler would provide hot water and heating to your central heating :)\nVisitor--950439497-7199(13:57:21):I do not actually have central heating and nor do I want it.  The fire is only 1 year old so would not wish to discard it.  We used to have an immersion heater so there may be a back boiler.  It is just the hot water in the winter I am seeking.\nFreddie(13:58:42):Right I see, unfortunately we would only be able to provide new combi boilers as a replacement\nVisitor--950439497-7199(13:58:54):Okay.

How can I help you?<br />\nVisitor--950439523-9901(17:58:38):I am trying to organise an annual boiler service but it's saying that I already have a contract. I don't have a contract - I had a boiler service last year and now I want another one.\nGemma(17:59:51):Ok let me check this for you, can I take your address and postcode please?\nVisitor--950439523-9901(18:00:14):31 Saw Mill Road, Colchester, Essex. CO1 2ZL.\nGemma(18:00:54):Thank you can I also take your name please?\nVisitor--950439523-9901(18:01:51):James Stacey\nGemma(18:03:53):Thank you, the previous gas appliance check agreement has lapsed its an annual service agreement as we have not received a reply to the renewal letter but it is not yet cancelled. The price is £93.43 you cannot set up a new service online however our HomeCare team can take payment for you and arrange the next service visit.  \nVisitor--950439523-9901(18:05:06):Ok - that's more than it was last year, isn't it?\nGemma(18:07:43):Its only a 12 month contract, it then goes in to a lapsed status if we have not received payment to renew this will remain for 3 months and then cancel.\nVisitor--950439523-9901(18:08:07):No, I mean the amount is higher\nGemma(18:10:44):Your price will\nvary year to year due to a number of factors which are used to determine your\nindividual pricing. These include the make, model, and age of your boiler, as\nwell as the size of your property. This means that the price\nof your service is unique to you and is line with what we've calculated to be a\nfair cost to cover you.\n\n<br />\n \nVisitor--950439523-9901(18:12:29):Last year it was 79.30, now it's 93.43 - is there nothing you can do to keep it closer to last year's price?\nVisitor--950439523-9901(18:12:51):I don't see a good reason why the price should increase by 15%\nGemma(18:16:26):I understand where you are coming from. We have a customer care team who will be able to see if we can apply a discount to reduce the price for you. You can contact them on 0800 294 9650 and this is open 24/7 and they will be able to help you further with this.\nVisitor--950439523-9901(18:16:37):Ok thanks.\nVisitor--950439523-9901(18:16:42):I'll phone them now.\nGemma(18:17:20):Thats no problem they will be able to reduce the price on this for you. \nVisitor--950439523-9901(18:17:39):Ok thanks for your help - goodbye.\n"
